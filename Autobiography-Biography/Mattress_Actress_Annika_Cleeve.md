# Mattress Actress - Annika Cleeve

## Summary
In the book Mattress Actress, Annika Cleeve shares her experience of eighteen years as a sex worker, where her troubled childhood led her to work in a brothel on the Sunshine Coast since she was fifteen. Anna reveals the truth of a sex worker's life:- the clients, the girls, the parlour bosses, the rip-off merchants, the drug deaths, the white slavery, the discrimination, the corrupt police and politicians, the exotic travel and money.

Annika begins the first part of the story with how she ended up as a prostitute, building a foundation for the narration of being a prostitute and finally ends with her retirement from the sex industry. The first part is filled with a sad childhood that lacking family's love and support. She is also a victim of adult men who frequently manipulate her naivety for sex, leading to her being sexually abused and having an abortion.

The second part shares the beginning of her prostitution life at fifteen. If the readers put aside any judgment against the profession, the book is no different than other biographies that offer the journey of someone's career. The writing is acceptable, at least is not too dull to read. Sometimes, the content can be repetitive and jumpy, such as discussing the different types of clients, but the next part jumps to her personal life. After several chapters, it returns to the stories about clients.

The book also includes the details of the prostitution system and how brothels and strip clubs function. I'm not surprised by the corruption in securing their business from the authorities, but I'm amazed that brothels can be very structural and systematic in their organisations. 

Besides revealing the hardship of a sex worker, it also touches on the challenges in marketing, pricing, and competition in the sex industry. It's surprisingly insightful, and many of the revelations are eye-opening for me. I feel it's a good book that digs deeper into the morally controversial industry, which is rarely discussed in such detail.

Initially, I thought I would hate this book when the beginning contains many self-praises of her beauty and body. The remaining story was an interesting read until, towards the end, the writer stressed too much of her worthiness and another round of self-praises. Perhaps I never cast any judgment on her from the beginning, so I never felt there was any relevance for her to defend her worthiness and capabilities. In fact, I think she is an intelligent woman with very strong adaptability skills. It's just she has an unlucky upbringing.
