# Uncle Tom's Cabin - Harriet Beecher Stowe

## Summary
- On a farm in the Kentucky plantation, Mr Shelby is discussing a business transaction with Haley, a slave buyer. Mr Shelby has to sell some slaves to raise money to pay off some debts. He decides to sell a slave named Tom, an honest and religious man.
- One slave is insufficient for Haley, and he is interested in buying another slave boy or girl. Eliza Harris, another of Mr Shelby's slaves, overhears Mr Shelby plans to sell her child, Harry. Eliza approaches Mrs Shelby and asks Mrs Shelby whether Mr Shelby is going to sell Harry. Mrs Shelby, uninformed of her husband’s financial woes, promises Eliza that Mr Shelby would never consider such a thing.
- Eliza is married to George. George is hired out to work in a factory nearby. He invented a machine which increases the speed of the work process and earns admiration from the factory's owner. However, George’s master removed him from the factory, saying that he only invented the machine because he was too lazy to work.  George's boss put him to work at menial labour, which caused him to rarely be able to see his wife. George tells his wife that he plans to escape to Canada, as he can no longer bear the torture from his master.
- Eliza overhears the conversation between Mr and Mrs Shelby about the sales of Tom and Harry. She decides to take her son to flee to Canada. Before she leaves, she tells Tom about the conversation between Mr and Mrs Shelby and asks him to tell George that she and her son are escaping to Canada. 
- Eliza crosses the Ohio River to go south.
- Tom is bought by Augustine St Clare after he rescues Augustine's daughter Eva when they are on the boat to New Orleans.
- Two plotlines: Northern and Southern.
- Eliza and Harry run away to the North for freedom and reunite with her husband, George, who has also escaped slavery.
- The story also emphasises the corruption in the slavery system.

## Personal Thoughts
* The accent makes it difficult to read. I believe it is overdoing it, causing the story to lose its purpose and making it difficult to follow because the writer is overly concerned with showing the authenticity of the accents.
* I find it nothing spectacular, but I understand why it was sensational or controversial at the time it was published. I don't feel the story is enjoyable to read. It has nothing to do with the controversies and criticisms mentioned by others, including inaccuracy of linguistic and racial stereotyping.
* Every chapter explains a particular character's virtues, particularly if they are religious. I dislike having the writer dictate how I should feel or interpret a character's nature.
* In short, it's a story about two separate slaves, Tom and Eliza, and her husband, George, with Tom serving as the protagonist. It tells the story of their journey to freedom and different masters they encountered during their life. Throughout the novel, there are numerous types of slaveowners, including vicious ones as well as a loving and anti-slavery master who nonetheless holds slaves.
* The story may lose its direction because the focus is primarily on debating various moral or religious concerns about slavery rather than creating a story. Religious individuals often lecture the non-religious, yet they are not as virtuous as they proclaim to be.
* Excessive religious content was more appropriate to read back then than it is today.
