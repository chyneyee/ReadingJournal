# Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China - Leslie T. Chang

## Summary
A journalist from the Wall Street Journal follows the life stories of female migrants who moved from rural areas to the big city of Dongguan in China to earn a living as factory workers. It's intriguing to read about the lives of factory workers in China. I have had this book with me for quite some time, and I quite regret not reading it sooner. I wonder if the lives of Chinese factory workers are still the same or if they have already improved after so many years.

The book covers the details of the different lives of the factory workers who usually migrated from farming villages to the factory city of Dongguan. The migrants face various life decisions, especially moving to the big city because there is no work at home. Friends they made in the factory can be untrusted, and even if they found one, the friendship might not last long due to uncertain circumstances such as quitting jobs for better wages or returning to their homes. Some factory workers choose to keep improving themselves by attending night classes to get a better job with a higher salary. Besides the fast-paced work environment and cramped living conditions, the book also delves into their personal lives, including their expectations for their future career and lifetime partners. 

Reading the various lives of women factory workers made me feel sorry for them for having such a tough life. I don't know whether I should feel lucky or embarrassed that my life has been blessed with a good education and better jobs than a factory worker. As an outsider, I can't stop raising my eyebrows with their various methods of continuously seeking a better life. However, their diligence and constant striving to improve themselves to achieve a better life are admirable. On a different matter, I was not too fond of how they measured success through material possessions and kept comparing and competing with others. I feel grateful and fortunate that I'm not living such a life because it sounds tiring and exhausting to always talk about money and branded possessions. Perhaps I shouldn't be judgmental and have no right to comment as I have never experienced or grown up in a rural place.

The second part covers the background of a specific migrant worker, for whom the writer travelled to her village to learn more about her family and friends. I feel heartless admitting that I'm more interested in the stories about migrant workers than the writer's family history. It started well, but as it went on, it got complicated because it involved several people with different backgrounds and continuous job switching. Their stories were told simultaneously, which sometimes made me lose what I was reading. Despite being lost towards the end, this is an in-depth research piece. I'm sorry that I wasn't interested in the writer's family history, and it's strange that she included her personal story in the book. I guess she wants to show the differences in migrations between the war period and modern generations.
