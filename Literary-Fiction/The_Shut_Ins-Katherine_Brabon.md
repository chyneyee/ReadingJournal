# The Shut Ins - Katherine Brabon

## Summary
> "There is a world we live in, on this side, and another world, achiragawa, that is a place of dreams, death and possibility. The other side may be our unconscious minds, our inner lives, the home of our deepest, unspoken beliefs."
<br>
The first note briefly describes the narrator's friend, M, who is from Japan but no longer lives there. They became friends when they used to study and live together in Melbourne. After learning the word 'achiragawa' from M, the narrator travels to Japan to search for its deeper meaning. M suggests the narrator a friend who can probably provide more insights about it.

The story begins with Mai, who introduces herself as a newly married woman with a husband called J. Besides the recent suicide incident in her apartment building, she also feels unsettled after the recent meeting with Hikaru's mother. Mai begins wondering how Hikaru's life is after he disappeared when they were eighteen. She remembers her school life with Hikaru and his unusual personality, which differs from others.

The story shifts to Mai's husband, J, a devoted salaryman with conservative thinking. Mai briefly mentions how they met, and the marriage seems to result more from her mother's encouragement than her willingness to commit to it.

When Mai bumps into Hikaru's mother, Mrs Sato, for the second time, this leads to the revelation of Hikaru's current state of living as a hikikomori who rejects the world and lives a confined life. Mrs Sato asks Mai to write letters to Hikaru, hoping this might change his life. As time goes by, Mai strongly anticipates visiting the Satos with letters to Hikaru.

Mai's account of her life indirectly reveals her inner feelings of being confined in a loveless marriage due to traditional norms. Meanwhile, Hikaru has become a recluse and separates himself from the outside world. Probably through Hikaru, Mai finds back the meaning of her existence, especially through their shared memories. Their silent but mutual understanding complements their existence in each other's lives.

The second part is about Sadako, who has an apparent connection to Mai, although Sadako never met Hikaru Sato. Sadako works as a hostess at a bar in Kabukicho. As the story goes further, we learn that J is one of her clients whenever he has a business trip to Tokyo. Besides Sadako's point of view about J, through Sadako, we also delve into J's dissatisfaction and expectations for his wife, who seems to be getting more distant from him. J reveals Mai's disappearance to Sadako, which indicates the beginning of changes in other characters' lives.

The third part begins with a brief note about the narrator's journey to a different part of Japan and her correspondence with M's friend. The third story about Hiromi Sato runs parallel to the accounts of Mai and Sadako. Hiromi couldn't understand Hikaru's world and how he became a hikikomori. It's because of the unknown; she feels it's her fault and responsibility for what happened to Hikaru. Hiromi feels it's natural to care for her frail mother, but it seems against nature to care for his adult son. When Mai stops visiting them, she feels guilty and wonders whether she didn't pay enough attention to Mai during their past conversations. There is a lot of reflection and looking into the past, probably to search for the cause or anything that she feels she should or shouldn't do to stop the situation from worsening.

The last part of the story is about Hikaru Sato, who lives a secluded life and worries about mistakes and consequences. He shares his inner world and thoughts from his childhood life, his effort to recover by going to the dormitory, and his feelings for his only connected friend, Mai.

## Notes
- If Mai has a child and faces a situation similar to Hiromi's, there is a higher chance Mai will face the same fate as Hiromi. Their responsibility is to conceal the family's shame, and Mai's husband will blame the son's mental state on her.
- The story has a vague ending, leaving it to the readers to come up with their own ideas for the ending.
- I wonder whether M is Mai and M's friend who has been corresponding with the narrator is actually Hikaru? The ending seems to suggest that Mai probably leaves for a different prefecture to search for another version of her, but I wonder whether she was pregnant at that time.
