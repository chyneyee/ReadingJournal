# Little Women (Little Women #1) - Louisa May Alcott

## Summary
> "Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents."

It's a story about the March family and their life in 1860s New England. The four daughters, Beth, Jo, Meg, and Amy, are in a gloomy mood during the Christmas season. There are no presents, and their mother doesn't want them to spend money for pleasure when men are at war. They decide to get something for their mother instead of for themselves. Their father is in the army serving as a chaplain.

## Personal Thoughts
I read this story several times during high school. It was the first time I read about someone earning money by cutting her hair, and this memory has stayed with me until now.

I never like feminine books but this is probably the only one I really love. The storytelling is simple but lots of meaningful themes within the story. Although the March family is poor, they always come up with something that results in pure joy and plain happiness. Despite their simple-minded thinking about happiness and being content, the story is written with a pragmatic approach which includes struggles and choices in every character's life.

The story would be more enjoyable and you will learn how to appreciate the story if you read it at a slow pace. In contrast, if you rush to finish the story, you will get bored easily and probably regret starting this book in the first place.

I used to think the story was about four sisters. When I reread the book this time, I personally feel that it's a story about four sisters but the main character is Jo. I think Jo deserves all the focus and attention based on her contributions to the family and she's a stand-out character in the story.

There is something about this story that attracts me although I'm not sure what it is. Maybe the prose, the writing style or my childhood memory of reading this book several times after I found it on a bookshelf. The story itself is just fine but not too great. There are times, I wish to finish the book quicker and wonder when all this going to end. Anyway, I still have a very high rating for the story.
