# Gweilo: A Memoir of a Hong Kong Childhood - Martin Booth

## Summary
This book is a memoir of Martin Booth's childhood in Hong Kong which he had written before he passed away from cancer. This memoir is intended for his children.

Martin began the story by recalling his experience on a ship to Hong Kong when he was seven. Martin's father was a Royal Navy civil servant and had been posted to Hong Kong. The voyage took a month. Before they reach Hong Kong, Martin shares his memories of the various stops and the people that he met throughout the journey.

Martin spent three years of his childhood in Hong Kong. He shares the stories of his encounters with people from all walks of life and various flora and fauna he found throughout his discovery. The memoir is very genuine and enjoyable to read. I love that the writer mentioned something cultural such as amahs, coolies, rickshaw riders, and a brief description of self-combed women. He also included a few historical incidents, such as the fire in the squatter settlement and the Ida typhoon. 

I feel it's a beautiful memoir, and no one has the right to criticise anything about it except his descendants. After all, the book is intended for his children, and it's his or his family's generosity to share it with us.
