Under forceful attempts and attacks by the Rebels, he openly opposed Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao. He was beaten repeatedly but still stood his ground. He was secretly admired by the Rebels for his strong will.
- One day in February 1967, he expressed his opinion to his wife about a realisation that the Cultural Revolution was a bloody purge to increase Mao's personal power. He wanted to write a letter to Chairman Mao and suggested to his wife to divorce for the sake of the family's safety.
- In late March 1967, the Tings came to see him and wanted to include him in the Revolutionary Committee. He rejected their offer and offended them when he told them their punishment was just.

He posted the letter by registered airmail. Three days after he posted the letter, three Rebels policemen arrested him because the letter had been intercepted. He knew he would get arrested but wanted to take a chance. When he was leaving, he asked his wife to stay loyal to the Party, divorce him, and take care of the children.
***
- Released in April but in a bad mental state. He was told a series of lies by his interrogators that led him to suspect his wife as a spy. He didn't know the real reason for his sudden release because the wife didn't want him to know that she had asked for a favour from the right-hand man of the Tings.

He was discharged. He and his wife were taken to Chengdu University and given a suite in a small self-contained courtyard with student guards at the gate.
- He refused to support Red Chengdu and represent them on the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee. One group spoke up for him for his rare character, but another was angry and threatened to beat him.

- He would not sell his soul after his wife asked him to write praises about the Tings on wall posters.
- In and out of detention for over a year until the end of 1968.
***
- Mao's new power system after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee caused the family income to be cut by more than half. All the capitalist roaders must move out of the compound to make room for the new leaders. The family was assigned some rooms at the top of a three-storey house with no running water or toilet. They had to go downstairs to brush their teeth. The new home was elegant and more beautiful, and they were punished with the despised beauty. The house was on Meteorite Street.

- The camp was under the direct control of the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee and, therefore, under the Tings. Still subjected to frequent denunciation meetings in the evenings after a hard day's work. He refused to wear a white armband with black characters saying 'counter-revolutionary element in action', and the Rebels backed away.

- He was still in Miyi, but part of his salary, which had been held since June 1968, was returned to him in 1972.
- End of May 1972, he was allowed to leave his camp. The camp doctors diagnosed him with dangerously high blood pressure, severe heart and liver trouble, and vascular sclerosis. They recommended a complete checkup in Peking. He left Miyi after three and a half years.

- On 12 June 1978, a senior official turned up at Meteorite Street bearing the Party's verdict on him. The senior official handed his wife a flimsy piece of paper written that he had been a good official and a good Party member.
