# The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm - Jacob Grimm, Wilhelm Grimm, Jack D. Zipes (Translator)

## Summary
This book consists of all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions from the two early volumes before the Grimms' extensive revisions. All these stories are translated by Jack Zipes and with new illustrations by Andrea Dezso. The translation retains the spare description and the storytelling style of the originals.

The two volumes were published primarily for scholars and educated readers. After the second volume in 1815, they made revisions of the stories more accessible to the general public and young readers. The continuous new revised editions had been edited to "downplay overt cruelty, eliminated tales that might be offensive to middle-class taste, replaced tales with more interesting variants, added some Christian homilies, and stylised them to evoke their folk poetry and original virtues."

I enjoyed reading the book, which is filled with emotions, and, most importantly, not all have happy endings. It has all sorts of stories, from horror to quirky, and some are ridiculously amusing. I found most stories about kings having bizarre requests before they give their daughters away for marriage.

The Stolen Pennies is a strange tale about a child who died four weeks ago but kept coming back to the house every day when the clock struck 12 at noon. The family couldn't see him except for the visitor. Then, the mother recalled that the child had hidden his two pennies in the cracks in the floor. The pennies were supposedly given to a poor man by the mother. The child has been looking for the pennies every day at noon. Once the parents gave the money to the poor man, the little child was never seen again.

The original version of Cinderella has no pumpkin carriage, just an ordinary horse carriage. There was no fairy godmother, and Cinderella had to go to her mother's grave and shake the tree to get the beautiful clothes, jewellery and shoes. There was no glass slipper but a golden slipper. The stepmother advised her daughters to cut off a piece of their foot to fit into the golden slipper. This original version is more horrific and intriguing.

The Little Red Cap or The Red Riding Hood has a few ending versions. The wolf ate both the grandmother and the Little Red Cap. He fell asleep after that, and the huntsman passed by. The huntsman cut the wolf's belly open and saved the grandmother and Little Red Cap. The wolf died when he tried to run away after they filled its body with large, heavy stones. Another ending was the wolf losing his balance on the roof, falling into the trough, and drowning.

The original version of Snow White is more interesting than the altered one. The queen tried several times to poison Snow White with different methods and poisonous items. The altered one is slightly out of context when the queen just appeared with a poisonous apple. The original version is hilarious when the servants carry the coffin everywhere for the prince. Then, the servant saved Snow White by removing the apple stuck in the throat. I personally feel the original story is more sensical than the altered version.
