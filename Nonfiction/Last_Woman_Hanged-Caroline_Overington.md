# Last Woman Hanged - Caroline Overington

## Summary
On 8 January 1889, Louisa Collins, a 41-year-old mother of ten children, became the first woman hanged at the Darlinghurst Gaol and the last in New South Wales.

Louisa had twice been married and also widowed twice. For over six months in 1888, she had been tried once for the murder of her first husband and thrice for the second husband. Her ten-year-old daughter May was one of the key witnesses to testify against her mother.

Louisa Collins died at a time when women were in no sense equal under the law, except when it came to the gallows. Women could not vote. They could not sit in parliament. There were no female judges and jurors.

Louisa married her first husband, Charles Andrews when she was eighteen, and he was a thirty-two widower. Louisa had an affair with one of the boarders, and Charles kicked her lover into the street. According to the scandalised neighbours, she continued the affair and neglected her children. A few days later, Charles suddenly became gravely ill. Louisa got their neighbour as a witness for Charles's will. When Charles finally died on 2 February, Louisa rushed to catch the tram into the city to inform the insurance people and bank staff. The doctor issued the death certificate with the cause of death due to acute gastritis.

Several days after Charles's death, Louisa not only abandoned the tradition of wearing dark mourning clothes, but she also hosted a party with her lover, Michael Collins. After three months, Louisa married Michael Collins when she was pregnant. Unfortunately, the marriage wasn't a happy one, with Louisa always drinking and Michael living idly and spending all the inheritance money. Louisa's tenth child was born but later died after four months old. Some weeks after baby John died, Michael Collins suddenly became ill. When he died, the doctor refused to issue a death certificate. The doctors were suspicious, and the police collected evidence in the house for the inquest.

The deaths of Charles, baby John and Michael Collins in such a short period were hard to believe was just a sheer coincidence. The city coroner ordered Louisa's arrest for the murder of Michael Collins and the exhumation of the bodies of Charles and baby John.

Louisa's statement indicated that Michael had a mysterious white powder in his coat. She also claimed she had no reason to kill Michael because he wasn't insured and left her penniless. The city coroner didn't believe that she was innocent, but the police couldn't find the existence of arsenic in Louisa's house or any proof that Louisa bought the poison.

When Louisa was convicted of murder and punished by hanging, it stirred the debate about whether to punish a woman in such a brutal manner. A group of women signed a petition to grant clemency from the execution. This led many people (primarily men) to scornfully voice their disagreement and believe that women had no right to question the law and that their fight for the heinous murderess was driven by sentimentalism.

## Personal Thoughts
The writer is very cautious in being judgmental and supported with research results via newspaper archives, stating that some sources came from unreliable, scandalous neighbours and most news editors at that time were men. Ultimately, she wanted to let the readers make the judgement by themselves as her job is to present the facts and the research analysis.

It's thoroughly researched and comprehensive. I really admired the beauty of the words used during olden times. I will never master it. Besides retelling the entire story of Louisa's life, I loved reading the various perspectives from both genders about the case. It was interesting to read about how men thought in the olden times, but some men had different views than their peers. At that time when women had no voting rights, it's admirable that some courageous women rise up to stand for something they believe in.

I feel Louisa probably murdered her first husband, Charles Andrews. At the same time, I still think there were so many doubts about his death, and no solid proof indicated that Louisa was the murderer. As for her second husband, Michael Collins, there were even more questions unanswered about his death. Regardless of whether Louisa was guilty of either or both of the murders, I feel it's injustice to be tried four times. She shouldn't be put into another trial if twice could not reach the unanimous vote. She was tried until they could get a conviction. Also, regardless of gender, capital punishment is inhumane, and no human being has the right to end another human's life. Furthermore, there were enormous doubts and unclear explanations surrounding the two cases, and capital punishment might cost an innocent life in such circumstances.
