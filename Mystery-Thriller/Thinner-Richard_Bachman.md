# Thinner - Richard Bachman

## Summary
Billy is an obese lawyer at age thirty-eight. The first chapter's title, "246", indicates Billy's new weight after losing three pounds. When he sees the number go down on the scale, he recalls the old Romani man who whispered the word "Thinner" to him when he and his wife, Heidi, left the courthouse.

Billy, who drove carelessly, had killed an old Romani woman while she was crossing the street. Billy escapes legal punishment due to his connections but is cursed by the woman's father with the word "Thinner". Since then, Billy has begun to lose weight rapidly regardless of how much he eats. The unknown reason for the continuous weight loss leads Billy to feel worried about whether he has cancer. Billy consults a series of doctors, but none of them can give him an answer to his problem.

Later, Billy discovers that Judge Rossington, who cleared him of manslaughter charges, is growing scales on his skin. The old Romani man touched Rossington's face, and the trouble began two days later. The scales keep growing and covering the entire body, including his mouth. At the same time, Duncan Hopley, the Fairview chief of police who committed perjury, is now experiencing uncontrollable acne.

Billy seeks help from private investigators to track the old Romani man. The old Romani man's name is Taduz Lemke. He is a hundred-six years old and the father of the woman that Billy had hit with his car. Billy follows the given information and finally tracks down Taduz Lemke. He confronts Lemke and tries to persuade Lemke to reverse the curse, but Lemke refuses unless Billy is willing to take the responsibility of killing his daughter. The Romani people threw Billy out of the camp before his hand was hit by a ball bearing fired from a slingshot by Gina, Lemke's great-granddaughter. 

Billy calls Ginelli for help, and Ginelli sends a mob doctor to treat Billy. Ginelli comes to see Billy and listens to his story. He decides to help Billy and reveals the details after he arranges the meeting between Billy and Lemke. The meeting resulted from Ginelli creating a series of chaotic and threatening scenes in the Romani's camp. When Lemke arrives, he brings a strawberry pie and adds Billy's blood from his wounded hand. Lemke explains that for the curse to be lifted, Billy must pass it to someone else by getting them to eat the pie. When Billy returns to the car, Billy only finds Ginelli's severed hand.

Billy plans to return home to feed Heidi with the pie as he still feels that Heidi is the one to be blamed for his predicament. He falls asleep, and when he wakes up, he is horrified that both Heidi and his daughter Linda have eaten the pie. The story ends with Billy eating the remaining pie.

## Personal Thoughts
- A peculiar yet unique story.
- I thought it would be one of the rare occasions with very straightforward storytelling and not much beat around the bush. However, the part about Ginelli retelling his adventure with the Romani people is one of King's most common storytelling attributes - draggy or long-winded. 
- Although I mentioned how draggy it is in every King's story I'd read, one thing always stays the same: I will never forget the story. The story is always either draggy or long-winded, but it remains in your memory for a long time.
