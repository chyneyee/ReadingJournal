# Storyline
Ana, who recently just broke up, decides to find new love on a dating app. The man worked as a chef at a wine bar. On their first night together, the sexual intercourse becomes a terrifying experience, leading Ana to remove the dating app from her phone.

Ana is still struggling to move on with her life after the breakup. Although she deleted her Instagram account, she created a dummy account to look for her ex's Instagram account. 

Then, one night, when Ana is having drinks with her colleagues, she meets Evan in the bar. Before they meet again for another drink, they've been messaging each other and later even connected on Facebook. Ana finds out from Facebook that Evan's ex-girlfriend, Emily, passed away less than a year ago.

Since then, Ana has become obsessed with Emily. She keeps visiting Emily'sprofile and history, which I'm not sure what she's looking for. Maybe she's looking for an identity or something to impersonate to win Evan's approval or perhaps treating Emily as her imaginary competitor.

# Personal Thoughts
I guess I'm too old for this kind of story about modern or dating app romance. Is this really how young people find love nowadays? I mean gambling with luck and hoping to win true love through an app. Is it too hard to find anything useful to do in life but easily get lonely? I couldn't comprehend why someone doesn't try to do something meaningful in their lives besides wasting time finding someone to sleep around or looking into someone's personal life. Why does someone waste their time on meaningless tasks that bring no benefits to themselves?

I know it's a fictional story, but I really can't tolerate such a simple-minded and desperate character. Honestly, it's deplorable to read such a story or a person. I really didn't enjoy reading it. I feel Ana is a sad character who continuously seeks love, companionship, recognition and assurance from others. She also worried too much about how others think about her. Why does she feel so insecure about herself? The further I read, the angrier I became. I wanted to shake Ana and tell her to stop torturing herself with the past through social media. Sometimes, I want to sympathise with her because she seems trapped, but when she keeps looking for Emily's personal life, I feel she's creepy. As if digging someone's life is not unpleasant enough, she would even show up in some places like Emily's workplace and Emily's brother's salon. I don't understand what she is trying to achieve.

I feel the ending was weak and unnecessary. It should have ended earlier, but the writer decided to lengthen it with Ana's neighbour to indicate that Ana will never stop with her social media habit. The directionlessness of this story or the character is comparable with the book description, which mentions it's "funny". I don't think it's funny at all. It's a sad story of a lonely woman who becomes a slave to modern technology and turns herself into a stalker.

I don't know why I keep reading until the end, despite it's an average story. I wish I could be harsh with the dull writing style, but it sounds too critical for a debut writer. At the same time, the entire story seems written in a monotonous tone, and the character is further cheapened by the lack of vocabulary to portray her with a better personality. I think the only reason I was able to finish the book is because I don't want to abandon another book this year. To be honest, it's really wasted my time.
