## Summary

### Hatamoto Family Case
#### File 20 - [The Hatamoto Family](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_020_-_The_Hatamoto_Family)
Conan and Ran enjoy the view from a luxury cruise ship, whose owners are charitably giving them a ride back to Tokyo since Kogoro forgot the departure time of their original boat. Conan and Ran notice another passenger, Natsue Hatamoto, who just married her husband, Takeshi, on the island they just left.

Gozo, the head of the Hatamoto family, then orders Takeshi to visit his room before dinner and leaves. After he leaves, Gozo's eldest daughter, Mariko, Natsue's older sister, Akie, and Akie's husband, Tatsuo, argue over who will inherit everything after Gozo finally dies. Akie whispers a shocking revelation to Mariko and mentions that there are only twenty-four hours of the cruise to change anything.

Meanwhile, Gozo knows Takeshi's identity is fake and wants to know how he intends to avenge his father. Later, Takeshi arrives late at dinner, just before everyone hears the butler's scream, leading everyone to rush to the room and discover Gozo's dead body.

#### File 21 - [The Secret of the Impenetrable Room](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_021_-_The_Secret_of_the_Impenetrable_Room)
Kogoro confirms Gozo's death and declares that he died approximately 40-50 minutes ago. 

The butler reports that before he opened Gozo's room door, he noticed a flower in front of the doorâ€”the flower Natsue had given to Takeshi. Mariko reports overhearing his conversation with Gozo about how Takeshi was the son of a Zaiki Isao, a business rival who committed suicide after the Hatamoto group took over his company. Takeshi confessed to being Zaiki Takehiko but denies murdering Gozo. Conan inspects the scene and discovers an unknown object in the blood spatter.

#### File 22 - [The Location of the Inheritance](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_022_-_The_Location_of_the_Inheritance)
Takeshi is locked in a storeroom to await arrest when the ship docks in Tokyo. The family members, except Natsue, are discussing the inheritance until the butler reveals the existence of a will that has appointed Natsue as the heir.

While Ran and Conan talking to Natsue about Takeshi, Conan hears strange sounds from the lower deck. They rush to the scene and only to find Tatsuo is dead. The family gathers at the scene. Kogoro and Conan run to the storeroom and discover it is unlocked and empty.

#### File 23 - [Family Obliteration](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_023_-_Family_Obliteration)
Everyone confirms Takeshi is the murderer when they find the storeroom is empty. Everyone gathers at the dining hall for their safety. An argument is started between Mariko and Akie. Mariko's son, Ichiro, goes to the bathroom. Suddenly, a blackout occurs. Conan and Ran rush to the bathroom to check on Ichiro. They find him still alive with a wounded leg.

#### File 24 - [Trap-Springer in the Dark](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_024_-_Trap-Springer_In_The_Dark)
Kogoro, Ran, Conan, and Kenji search the ship, including the rooms. Conan has a surprising finding when he opens Akie's closet. He asks the butler a question, and the butler is shocked that Conan knows the family secret.

Conan lures Kogoro back into Akie's room and knocks him out using Agasa's latest invention, the Stun-Gun Wristwatch. Conan tells Ran to gather the family on Kogoro's behalf. Ran and the others arrive after Conan hides out of sight, and Conan uses the bow tie to change his voice to Kogoro to explain that he knows who the criminal is.

### Monthly Present Case
#### File 26 - [The Curious Presents](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_026_-_The_Curious_Presents)
A new client, Dr Ogawa, arrives at the agency with a mountain of toys. He explains to Kogoro that he has received one million yen and several monthly toys for the last two years. The surgeon also received a strange note with the last payment, claiming the payer must collect something for what he had paid.

Conan realises that the toys don't have modern barcodes, leading Kogoro to wonder whether it is a prank. Ran begins to suspect whether Conan and Shinichi are the same person, as both have very high analytical skills.

#### File 27 - [The Same Person](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_027_-_The_Same_Person)
Dr. Ogawa realises that a valuable painting at the hospital is probably in the interest of the anonymous sender. At the hospital, Dr. Ogawa receives morning glory flowers from the same unknown sender, as he has on August 3rd for the last two years. Conan suggests checking on Dr. Ogawa's patient medical records for anything related to August 3rd. Kogoro finds nothing useful in the records and leaves to examine the painting. Conan opts to stay behind.

Ran recalls Conan's behaviour in previous cases, similar to Shinichi, and how Conan arrived the day Shinichi disappeared.

#### File 28 - [The Mystery of August 3rd](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_028_-_The_Mystery_of_August_3rd)
Ran is very convinced that Conan must be Shinichi. To hide his identity, Conan grabs a "Gameman" and a video game cartridge and pretends to love playing it like a kid. In the video game, Conan discovers who the anonymous sender is. They have to act fast before the doctor's son is in danger.

#### File 29 - [Safe Before Eyes](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_3#File_029_-_Safe_Before_Your_Eyes)
Conan and the others race to the park to save Dr Ogawa's son, Yuta, before it's too late.
