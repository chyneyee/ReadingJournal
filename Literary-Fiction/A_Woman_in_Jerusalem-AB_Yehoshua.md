# A Woman in Jerusalem: A Passion in Three Parts - A.B. Yehoshua, Hillel Halkin

## Summary
### Part 1 - The Manager
- A woman in her forties was heavily wounded and later died after a bombing in the Jerusalem market the week before.
- The only identification is a pay slip issued by the company. 
- During those two days, nobody visited her in the hospital. Even after her death, she had lain in the hospital morgue abandoned and unidentified.
- The newspaper criticised the well-known bakery for being inhuman and included a blurry photo of the resources manager.
- The owner assigns the resource manager to identify and bury the woman for the sake of the company's reputation.
- The woman has a mechanical engineering background. She came from a small village and held a temporary residence status. She separated from her husband for another man and has a thirteen-year-old son.
- The company has no record that she was fired from the job, but at the same time, the resources manager doesn't remember anything about her employment. Later when they find out that she is a cleaner, the resources manager and his secretary question the supervisor in the bakery. It was a mutual or private termination of employment between the supervisor and the mysterious woman. 
- At the time when the woman is killed by the bombing, she is no longer employed by the bakery. For this reason, the human resources manager feels it shouldn't be the company's fault. There is nothing to apologise and the editor should cancel the article's publication.
- The resources manager asks the author of the article to cancel the article but he refuses.

### Part 2 - The Mission
- The owner wants the human resources manager to represent the company to accompany the murdered woman to the funeral. It's the owner's wish for atonement. The ex-husband wants the woman to be buried in her home soil so that their son can visit her grave.

### Part 3 - The journey 
- This part tells the journey of bringing the coffin to be buried at the place where she was born. It is located in a rural village and the resources manager travels with the consul's husband, a journalist and his photographer, and the woman's son.

## Personal Thoughts
I don't know what to say about this story. Something different? But I really like the setting in the bakery and the baking goods smell great.

The writing style has been very confusing from the beginning. The story also seems merry-go-round. Above all, nothing can be worse than the ending. I felt my time was wasted after reading the entire story when the ending is back to square one.
