# How I Became A North Korean - Krys Lee

## Summary
This story is divided into four parts:- Crossing, The Border, Safe and Freedom. It focuses on three main characters from different backgrounds: Yongju, Jangmi, and Danny.

Yongju's story begins with his family in Pyongyang in 2009 when he was twenty-one. He was born into a prominent family with a comfortable life compared with other North Koreans. His mother is a famous actress, and his father runs the government trading bureau. Yongju recalls the night that his father was shot by the Dear Leader at a party, the night before they fled the country.

In 2009, Danny was sixteen and was bullied in school after reporting someone for cheating in an exam. He is a devoted Christian but finds it hard to adapt to American life after moving from China when he was nine. He is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and a permanent resident of the United States of America. His mother was born in North Korea and crossed back into China early.

From a very young age, Jangmi learned that following rules in the country would not lead anywhere. After the famine and the money devaluation, she had to gamble her life to protect her unborn child. She paid a broker for a Korean husband in China and bribed the officials to cross the river.

## Personal Notes (Spoiler Alert)
### Jangmi
- She pays a broker to arrange a marriage to a man named Seongsik with an eight-year-old daughter. Seongsik is a Korean who lives in China and was involved in an accident while working at a factory in South Korea. He has a prosthetic right leg.
- Jangmi plans to tell Seongsik that she's pregnant, but before that, Seongsik suspects her pregnancy happened before they met. He feels upset and becomes distant, but simultaneously, he needs her. Before he knows what to do with Jangmi, his mother intervenes and kicks Jangmi out of the house.
- A week after she left the mountains or the Yongju's group with the stolen goods, she was betrayed by a Joseon-jok woman and sold to a local gang. A group of men kidnaps her and takes her to the place that holds more women who sell to Chinese men after being tricked by brokers. Jangmi has to take her clothes off in front of the computer. She has to do whatever her client is asking her to do.
- Missionary Kwon rescues her from the continuous slavery. However, she is no longer the same as before. She lost her baby and tried to commit suicide.
- Jangmi is always calculative and assumes everyone wants something from her. She trades her body to Missionary Kwon for the South Korean dream.

### Danny / Daehan Lee
- Nearly drowned with his life vest at the Bible camp, which makes him embarrassed to go to school.
- His father decided to send him to China for a few weeks to see his mother, hoping that he could take a rest and become "normal". His father misunderstood that he was attempting suicide.
- He is a Joseon-jok, an ethnic Korean who'd lived alongside the Han Chinese in northeastern China.
- Danny's mother works as a missionary in Yanji, China. When Danny arrives at her apartment, he accidentally finds Deacon Shin hiding in his mother's wardrobe.
- Danny runs away from the house after finding out about his mother's extramarital affair. He becomes homeless and works odd jobs to survive. He feels lost and doesn't want to return to his parents.
- One day, he was robbed and lost all his possessions, including his passport. He becomes paperless and undocumented. Yongju and his friend Cheolmin save him from the robbers. Danny follows them to return to the cave as he has nowhere to go and longs for companionship. 
- Danny wants to help his new friends to seek asylum in South Korea. He has to call his mother to help his friends.
- Although he used to be a devoted Christian, the experience with his North Korean friends cast a different perspective on the religion.

### Yongju
- A stranger appears at Yongju's house and later drives his family to the countryside and heads to the border. His mother reveals to him that his father has been shot at the party.
- When they reach China after crossing the border, the human trafficker takes the women and drives them somewhere else. Yongju is separated from his mother and sister.
- Yongju and Namil, an experienced border-crosser, join the others and live in a cave. Danny joins them after they rescue him from a robbery. 
- The church pastor gives them some clothes and money. He couldn't help them flee to South Korea under the government crackdown. When they are on their way to return home, they find Jangmi in the wilderness.
- With the help of Missionary Kwon and Missionary Lee, Yongju and a few others are given new life and live in a safe house. Unfortunately, they later only realise that they must meet some conditions if they want to leave for South Korea.

## Personal Thoughts
- I can feel the alienation and strangeness in the new world for Jangmi. She needs to survive in the new world, depending on a stranger who has helped her to cross the border. She is treading carefully with the delicate relationship in which both rely on each other, although the focus seems to be on her needing him more than he needs her.
- Themes - run away from problems and difficulties, Christianity, the wife has another lover, the hypocrisy of religious devotees, greed, trust issues, striving for freedom.
- Sometimes, I feel confused with the storyline due to difficulty following the sentence structure. Strangely, the side characters have a more apparent ending than the main ones. I wish we would know more about what happened to Missionary Kwon, and the vagueness of Jangmi and Yongju is irrelevant. Everything has been very straightforward except those endings.
