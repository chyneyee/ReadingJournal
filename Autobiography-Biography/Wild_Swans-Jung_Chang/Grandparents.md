## Yu-fang (1909) 
- Maternal grandmother of Chang and mother of Bao Qin. 
- A beauty with five feet three inches, and the most remarkable asset was her bound feet which had been bound since she was two years old. 
- She was trained as a perfect lady or a high-class courtesan. She attended girls' school to be literate, learned to play Chinese chess, mahjongg and go, and studied drawing and embroidery. A tutor was hired to teach her to play qin, a musical instrument like a zither. 
- Her father asked her to go to a temple on a specific day to create a chance to encounter Xue Zhi-heng without her knowledge. She won the prize for guessing the most riddles in the lantern-riddles contest and played qin exceptionally well. It enchanted General Xue, which led to a proposal to be taken as a concubine. 
- She knew her father's intention a few days before the event through her mother but had no right to oppose it despite the fact she hated to be a concubine. 
- General Xue offered to buy a house, especially for her, so she could stay in Yixian after marriage. She thought she loved him after spending three days with him after the wedding. After a week, he told her he had to leave, and her duty was to wait for him until he returned. She waited six years. 
- She blackened her face with soot to make herself look filthy and ugly during the warlord battle. The renewed fighting between the warlord enemies to gain control, widespread looting, and rape were commonplace.
- Experienced loneliness and misery when living with several servants, which also acted as guards and spies, not allowing her to go out alone. She hardly went out and was confined in the house. 
- Never short of money as she received a regular allowance from General Xue, delivered by the manager of his pawnshop. She ignored General Xue's suggestion to smoke opium which most concubines were addicted to cope with the loneliness. 
- Stalled General Xue several times from going to Lulong, but unavoidable when he was ill. 
- Xue's wife told her that her daughter (Bao Qing) would be brought up as the wife's own daughter and would not call her mother. She has to treat the child as the young mistress of the house. 
- She successfully escaped from the household in Lulong with her daughter and returned to Yixian. She couldn't take her daughter to her house for fear of servants and asked an old school friend if she could hide her daughter. The friend lived in her father-in-law's house, a Manchu doctor called Dr Xia. Later, she sent a telegram to Lulong saying the daughter had fallen ill on the train and had died. 
- After receiving the telegram about Xue's funeral, she ignored the summon to attend the funeral. Her parents received a letter from Xue's wife, and Xue's last words to her were to give her freedom. She was free at the age of 24. 
- She was stronger than her mother (Wu 'Er-ya-tou') and fought for herself and for her mother. After she moved back to her parents' house, she had a nervous breakdown after constant pressure from her father to remarry.
- Under pressure and several objections from Dr Xia's family, she remarried Dr Xia at age 26 in 1935 when Bao Qing was four.
- Experienced freedom but feeling entrapped in Dr Xia's house.
- Never experienced poverty until she moved to Jinzhou with Dr Xia, but that was the happiest time in her life. She even had many women friends in the neighbourhood.
- Selling off some of the jewellery given by General Xue to support the family.
- Distressed by her husband's downcast over his family's condition and growing distance from the husband due to the burden of the eldest son's suicide.
- Dug out some small gold pieces to bribe the Kuomintang soldiers after they accused her daughter of giving signals to the enemy.
- She was worried about Bao Qin's interest in Wang Yu because he was an official. She felt most officials had a bad name among ordinary Chinese, and their power usually treated women indecently. She assumed Wang Yu was already married and wanted her daughter as a concubine because he was well beyond the marrying age for men in Manchuria.
- Appalled with the daughter as a bride walked to the bridegroom's house and dismayed that her daughter didn't have a traditional wedding.
- Favoured Hui-ge as her son-in-law.
- She was despised by the women from the Federation because of her Kuomintang connections and also was a concubine.
- She no longer practised foot-binding after married because the Manchus didn't practise it, but the feet remained crippled and shrunken.
- Had a document that said she was the mother or revolutionary, which allowed her to be provided by the Party with food, accommodation, and money along the way to Yibin.
- In Yibin (1950), she started selling jewellery to buy food in the market, keen to take care of her pregnant daughter. She broke the rule by cooking at home, which led to complaints about the daughter being 'bourgeois' and pampered.
- She left Yibin after spending time with her daughter for more than a month. Mrs Mi and her son-in-law were against her staying with her daughter due to the Communist rules. 
- In August 1951, she arrived at Yibin with Dr Xia.
- She fainted from grief over the loss of her husband and anger when arguing with her son-in-law, who rejected the idea of having monks at the funeral due to his Communists principles. She had a nervous breakdown after her husband's funeral and had to be hospitalised for almost two months. She lived with her daughter's family after being discharged from the hospital.
- When Dr Xia died in 1952, the ownership of the medicine shop was passed to her. The state offered her with ridiculously low price to buy out the medicine shop.
- She was reluctant to give away her jewellery for donations to the Party but did it after being advised by her daughter. She was still sceptical to fully trust the Communist Party.
- In the summer of 1956, she returned to Chengdu and collected all the grandchildren from the nurseries after the daughter and son-in-law were too busy with their work for the Party.
- She developed slight oedema during the famine.
- When her daughter returned home in pain from the torture of ex-convicts, she used tweezers and a needle to pick glass fragments out of her daughter's knees. She made her daughter a pair of thick kneepads and a padded waist protector.
- She collapsed and felt piercing all over her body when approaching her sixtieth birthday.
- Died in 1969.
