# Flawless - Elise Hu

## Summary
- The book is not what I expected but it's not a bad read. I was expecting a purely investigative or journalism perspective. The book begins with the writer sharing her experience living in Korea for work and her experiment with various beauty products. 
- Offers extensive knowledge of the Korean beauty and cosmetics industry.
Korea's unique concept and culture of beauty are the key factors for the country's capability to continuously churn out new products within a short period.
- The drive for newness is relentless.
- The birth of K-beauty began in the Joseon Dynasty under Confucius's influence.
- Once you learn some techniques or find products that work, you will be obsessed with trying and buying them. It comes with the risk that the more you buy, the more you want.
- Cultural norm of lookism - appearance-based discrimination.
- Working hard to beautify themselves to fit in and compete in society.
- Social media has become the guidelines on how to become beautiful which made us obsessed with improving and beautifying ourselves to reach the standard defined by the world. 
- Cosmetic surgery has become habituated and routinised.
- Makeup is being introduced, and the kids that use beauty care are getting younger as the years go by.

## Personal Thoughts
- It sounds very exhausting to be a Korean woman. 
- Sometimes, it seems they lost themselves in creating an appearance to avoid societal judgement and to get a job. In reality, most women probably don't need Botox or some of the unnecessary surgeries when they already look beautiful or maybe overqualify for the job. 
- The only part I disliked was the inclusion of the writer's personal life. I understand that she wanted to relate her experience and opinions about the discussed topics but for unknown reasons, sometimes, I feel the opinions are more from an American perspective than as a general outsider or a non-Korean woman. 
- What is perfect? Where is the line of perfection and who draws the line?
- I like how the writer describes the development of cosmetic surgery and the trend in Korea. 
- It feels pathetic and depressed if keeps getting assessed and judged from job application to matchmaking service. Every woman needs to meet specific requirements for height and weight. They were given points for their beauty.
- I still feel the writer shouldn't include her personal life which is very contradictory to the discussion in the book. One point is that she is dissecting and analysing the ugly side and other negative impact of cosmetic surgery. On the other hand, she went to get the cosmetics injection. The worst part is she seems to be discussing the makeup on kids as a serious issue but on the other side, she shares the story of bringing her daughter to a baby spa. When she even includes the story of her father painting her daughter's nails and the selling point is family bonding, I feel that sounds defensive or hard-selling what other cosmetics companies are selling for which she seems to have disagreed with the marketing strategy before that.
- As a reader, I feel very confused with the writer's standpoint. Initially, she seemed to be doing an experiment with various beauty products. Then, as she lives longer there, it seems she either falls under societal pressure or becomes a victim of the daily advertisements in Korea. She went for a cosmetic injection, brought her daughter to the baby spa and the young daughter got her nails painted by her grandfather. At the same time, she raises all the issues that exist in the aesthetic industry and defends herself that she is trying to balance between care and consumerism. I don't have any opinions and I don't judge someone's personal choice to go for an aesthetic surgery as it's not my concern, but since she is writing a book about the aesthetics industry, I'd rather not know about her personal decision. This made me feel the writer lacked neutrality or objectivity. How can someone criticising the aesthetic industry but become a participant herself?
- The book covers a lot of key areas and even includes extensive research and the writer's opinions on the discussed topics. For me, the ruining part is the addition of her personal details which are sometimes forcefully related to the discussion, for example, the daughters' conversation about beauty and praises their mother is beautiful.
