# Becky Lynch: The Man: Not Your Average Average Girl - Rebecca Quin

## Summary
Wow. I could hear the voice of Rebecca, a.k.a. Becky Lynch, from the beginning when I started reading this book. I thought it would be a serious and formal biography, but the first chapter indicates that it will be a fun and relaxing book filled with positive vibes.

I thought this would be an ordinary biography, but it's actually a very inspiring and empowering story about fighting for your dream and going against others who plant doubts in you. No one knows your capabilities more than yourself, and nobody will fight for your dream except yourself. 

Most of the time, Becky has no idea how things will turn out, but she has the "You never know if you never try" or the "do or die" attitude. Do it first and think about the rest later. Although she continuously doubts whether things will turn out according to her plan, she has the mindset of "at least I tried".

I can sense she really bares her soul in this book. There's a lot of honesty and raw emotions, and she has no hesitation in expressing her inner feelings.
