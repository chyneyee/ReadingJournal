# The Other Pandemic: How QAnon Contaminated the World - James Ball

## Introduction
- It comes in four parts - an account of the roots of QAnon, its emergence, how it became prominent, and why it has turned into something new and persistently dangerous.
- 'Q Clearance Patriot' started with the first post about the extradition of Hillary Clinton on 4chan. Despite Hilary Clinton remaining free and several follow-up posts later, Q's posts acted as a kick-start for the sprawling online conspiracy theory and later became the famous movement QAnon.
- QAnon is a digital pandemic, a pathogen affecting us and threatening humanity. It had precursors built over a decade and mutated something new even before the January 6 riots. The movement is still evolving, merging with the anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown movements, and continues to change.
- Repurpose old ideas, conspiracies, and plots to new audiences and times. The stories are also combined in new ways to create a deep rabbit hole that is so compelling people can't help but crawl down into it.

## Part 1 - Emergence
- The history and the mechanism or structure of 4chan.
- A brief story of other groups seeded and grew in 4chan, such as Anonymous and Gamergates. The various movements or groups which contribute to the formation of QAnon.
- Timelines of key events (e.g. Charlottesville rally, Pizzagate) and several infamous names involved with the rising of the movements.
- Most posts started with trolling, harmless or insensitive jokes for fun. It led to the spawning of movements beyond their imaginations as they turned into radicalisation within members; utilising the loneliness and isolation of members; believing most elites are morally bankrupt and engaged in crimes; and radicalised a small number of their believers into violent direct action.
- QAnon constantly shifts according to the flow of current events and the breadcrumbs of information with your own research. This allows people to choose what they want to believe, with no fixed beliefs and no leader. 
- QAnon contacts Youtube influencers to reach wider audiences beyond 4chan. Able to spread and mutate in a new way which no other groups successfully did.

## Part 2 - Infection
- Encourages people to come to their own conclusions and do their own research.
- The emergence of YouTube videos and online documentaries about conspiracies.
- QAnon movement creates a community sense of belonging as collectively have seen through the lies of those so-called experts. They work together and find the truth denied to us by the government, the media, academics, and scientists.
- Brings together extremely online teenagers, old-school far-righters, suburban mums, and their health and wellness gurus, business execs, wellness gurus and devotees of traditional religion.
- Algorithms of the mainstream social networks will keep feeding someone with more conspiratorial videos after watching one.
- The inaction from social media due to mercenary and politically complex had caused the conspiracies to get bigger. It takes more effort to debunk the conspiracies than to make an outrageous false claim. 
- Backslash effect - potential new recruit if mainstream covers the conspiracy theories even if only 1% of viewers believe in it.

## Part 3 - Transmission
- Unix operating system has the term kill a child (terminate a subprocess) can be turned into a conspiracy or a dark meaning or hidden code to what the QAnon wanted to believe is related to child trafficking.
- Lockdown restrictions during the pandemic meant more free time for people to 'do your own research '. Social media recommends endless content leading users to QAnon-linked rabbit holes.
- Take action in the early stage when someone is interested in Q for curiosity before the person spends more time in his research.

## Part 4 - Convalescence
- Interesting reading about the undercover sociologist Leon Festinger joining the apocalypse cult by Dorothy Martin for his own research about cognitive dissonance.
- The popularity of QAnon is caused by coincidental factors such as the pandemic, social media not taking serious responsibility for cleaning up its act and the rise of populism. 
- QAnon modified itself to fit its time, audience and habitat. It continuously evolves ideas without leader.

## Personal Thoughts
- In-depth and insightful analysis of QAnon from the emergence stage to its rising.
- The author is knowledgeable, analytical, and thoughtfully discusses the danger of the QAnon movement.
- I felt being guided to the underground of another world with the revelation of secrets and layers of hidden codes unknown to the tourists like other readers.
- It's always fascinating when reading about cults and conspiracies. It never fails to amaze me how the brains of human beings work. It always makes me wonder how skewed a person's thinking is after presented with facts. How can another human being (same species, homosapien) form a different and strange belief than ourselves?
- What I learned from this book? How QAnon started, how it went viral, its targeted audiences and member recruitment, the creative thinking of conspiracists, Pizzagate and satanic ritual abuse.
