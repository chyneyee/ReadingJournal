# The Best Bad Luck I Ever Had - Kristin Levine

## Summary
The narrator Harry Otis Sims or Dit begins his story with how wrong he was about Emma Walker whom he thought was bringing bad luck to him since the day she arrived in the town.

The setting of the story is in Moundville, Alabama during the 1910s. Most of the people there are farmers. Mr Walker is the new postmaster who just arrived in the town with his wife and a daughter named Emma. He is responsible for sorting and delivering the mail, and also sending and receiving telegrams. They come from Boston, and back then, there weren't many black people in the postal service.

Dit hoped the new postmaster had a boy to play baseball but was disappointed with Emma's gender rather than her skin colour. Dit and Emma have many differences of opinion on many things. Dit has a black friend called Elbert. Elbert's father was called Doc Halley and was a barber. He has a barber shop where all the men in town get their haircuts. Dit witnesses racial issues happening to his friends. But as a white boy, Dit doesn't know how to stand up for his friends, and he can't see the problem of the differences in skin colour like an adult at that time.

When an accidental shooting incident occurs in the town, Doc is accused of the killing and sentenced to be hanged by the decision of a group of white jurors. Emma and Dit plan to save Doc's life before the execution, especially Dit, who feels guilty for the escalation of the situation.

## Personal Thoughts
- A simple life of Dit, a boy who struggles to understand racial issues and differences in a small town. 
- We can see the gradual influence of Emma on Dit, where he is more analytical and opens his eyes to things that he's never understood before.
- A beautiful friendship between Emma and Dit that overcomes their differences and complements each other very well. The story is written beautifully with multidimensional characters that leave a long-lasting impression on the readers.
