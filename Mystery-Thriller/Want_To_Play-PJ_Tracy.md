# Want To Play? (Monkeewrench #1) - P.J. Tracy

## Summary
In a small town in Wisconsin, Father Newbury finds an old couple, John and Mary Kleinfeldt, murdered at the church in the early morning. Mary's chest is carved with a cross. The old couple used to report homosexuals to Father Newbury, causing some others to be banned from the congregation. At the same time, in Minneapolis, a dead jogger was murdered near the river. The dead jogger is Jonathan Blanchard, a seminary student.

Meanwhile, a software company named Monkeewrench is developing a detective game that focuses on looking for killers. The murder cases in the game have too many similarities with the recent murders happening in the city. There are probably around 500+ suspects in the game. Since the game was released in stages, the developers shut down the server after they read the murders on the news.

Sheriff Halloran and his deputy Danny go to the Kleinfeldts' house and find a stockpile of guns, survivalist books and magazines and even a set-up shotgun. The old couple has a hidden identity, and Kleinfeldt is not their real name. They keep changing their name every time they move to a newer place. The couple used to live in Atlanta with the alias Bradford and had a hermaphrodite child. The doctor who delivered the baby told the sheriff that the couple never gave a name and gender for the baby due to their religious belief. The hermaphrodite child is defined as he and his name is Brian. He was dropped off by his parents at a Catholic boarding school. He got his high school diploma when he was sixteen and then disappeared. He is believed to be in Atlanta after the school received a transcript request from Atlanta.

Ten years ago, the Monkeewrench employees were all seniors at Georgia State in Atlanta. Five people were murdered on campus that fall. Four of the victims were close friends of Grace. The FBI assigned an undercover as her friend, but the undercover also got killed. The FBI suspected Grace and her friends and even wanted to use Grace as bait. Later, the Monkeewrench group disappeared without leaving a trace to avoid the FBI's scrutiny.

## Spoiler
<details>
<summary>The Ending</summary>
  
- Mitchell Cross is James Mitchell, and his wife Diane is D. Emanuel, also known as Brian Bradford.
- Sharon Mueller was shot by Diane in the throat when she was on the way to the Monkeewrench office. The ending reveals she is alive, probably saved by Mitch, who appears at the scene just in time.
- Diane had killed random people based on the game profile, but the real motive was to destroy the game. She doesn't want any players to reach level fifteen in the game, which exposes the crime scenes in Atlanta. She has to kill her beloved husband Mitch because he walked in after she shot Sharon. Mitch disagrees with Diane's plan to kill Grace. Diane reveals to Grace that Mitch is the killer who murdered five people in Georgia because Mitch loves Grace. He was going to kill Diane, so she didn't kill Grace, and Diane shot him.
- Diane was shot multiple times by the police when she wanted to kill Grace.
- Diane was the murderer who killed her parents, the Kleinfeldts. Brian Bradford went under the knife after a week after his eighteenth birthday. He changed his name to D. Emanuel, which happens to be the Mother Superior's name before she was promoted. Diane enrolled at Georgia State and has honours in Computer Science. 
- Mitchell Cross's parents died in a suspicious house fire when he was thirteen. Then, he was pulled in for stalking some high-school girl, and a month later, her boyfriend and brother were stabbed to death.

## Personal Thoughts
- The writer introduces various characters from different places, but only a few details are given. It's fragmentary, and the writer keeps dropping new characters as the story progresses. 
- The plot sounds interesting, but it doesn't feel as exciting as it should be when reading it. However, occasional humour and banter made the reading slightly enjoyable or reduced the dullness.
- Some scenes can be overdramatic, and the jokes can be overdone, but it's a good story to kill time.
- The main focus is Grace and how the game is related to all those murders, but in the end, there is no explanation of how all those murders took place, especially those that occurred under heavy scrutiny by the police.
- The story focuses more on the cases in Minneapolis, and most characters are based in Minneapolis. I feel it's irrelevant to include the story in Wisconsin because it feels confusing and overwhelming. I would prefer it to be purely focused on Minneapolis, and the ending can briefly explain what happened in Wisconsin about the killer's background.
