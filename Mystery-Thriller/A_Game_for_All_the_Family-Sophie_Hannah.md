# A Game for All the Family - Sophie Hannah

## Storyline
Justine Merrison and the family move to Speedwell House in Devon, leaving behind her career in London. Four months later, Justine feels something is off with her daughter Ellen. She finds a strange story written by Ellen and determines to find out the root cause of her daughter's change of behaviour.

When Ellen tells her mother that she is upset with the school for expelling her best friend, George Donbavand, Justine wants to fix the injustice, but when she brings it up to the head teacher, the head teacher insists that there is no student in the school with the name George Donbavand.

Meanwhile, an anonymous caller begins harassing Justine and threatening her to move back to London.

The main story is intertwined with the fictional murder story written by Justine's daughter, Ellen. Somehow, I felt Ellen's imaginative story was more intriguing than the main plot. I felt Justine seemed weird and intolerable. She has so much rage about everything, especially if she can't get things to follow her way.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

- George Donbavand is real. Justine keeps pushing the school to tell the truth, especially the existence of George and his expulsion. She trusts her daughter and continuously pushes the teachers for the revelation.
- According to the head teacher, George's mother, Anne Donbavand, has extreme security measures for her children's safety at school. The teachers have to inform Anne if anyone is close to her children and if any new staff or students come to the school. Anne tells the children that someone out there is trying to get her children for revenge, which forces the school to be very protective of the Donbavands. Anne asks the head teacher to create a fake expulsion on George so she can withdraw her son from the school.
- Justine hires a private investigator to find out about the Donbavands. 
- Before Justine leaves the school after the revelation, one of the teachers gives her the story written by George. Justine is shocked when reading the story because the entire story is about her, including her former colleagues, her reasons for leaving London, and her job.
- Anne barges to Justine's house after knowing George has been to their house recently. Justine is angry with Anne's rudeness of entering the house without permission. She decides to do the same and goes to Anne's house. After helping George to leave the house by smashing the door, Justine goes through Anne's house and finds several leaflets of urns and coffins, details of Speedwell House and a list of Justine's contacts. Justine feels the family is unsafe and decides to move to the house of her dog breeder, Olwen.
- Justine and Olwen hatch a plan and trick Anne into coming to Olwen's house. To get into Justine's mind, Olwen acts as Anne's imaginary sister, Allisande Ingrey (based on Ellen's story). In the end, Justine kills Anne when she tries to save a dog when she believes Anne wants to kill the dog on her lap.
- Justine and Olwen dump the body somewhere, and they get away with the murder. Towards the end, Anne's husband, Stephen, indicates that he knows Justine is the murderer.

## Personal Thoughts
- The story's beginning doesn't sound right when Justine is overly obsessed with her daughter's homework. I really can't imagine someone doing that. I wondered whether the writer was trying to create suspense, but it did not make sense.
- Justine seems like a psychotic mother who is annoying and hard to be pleased with. She is unbearable and difficult to read when she talks to the police because she always wants to argue and win all the time. When in the school, she criticises everything, including other kids and their parents, almost everything and everyone. I don't know who is more torturing, me reading such a lunatic character or Ellen having such a crazy mother.
- I've never heard of a mother who trusts her daughter so much but doubts the teachers or the entire school is lying to her.
- It's challenging to follow the character Justine because she is so contradictory. She doesn't trust what the teacher said about George living dangerously and keeps verbally attacking the school for protecting the Donbavands without proof. But when she reaches home and finds that George is at her home, she wants him to leave because she worries about their safety. So, which side she is on?
- This is one of the most ridiculous stories, and Justine would be one of the most despised characters I've ever read. A mother suspects her daughter's written story is real because the names are weird, and she doesn't believe a fourteen-year-old teenager could come out with those names. Then, the mother suspects her daughter was writing her friend's mother's childhood story, and they are swapping family stories. Later, she asks everyone, including her recently met dog breeder and some of the teachers, because she suspects they are related to the fictional story. She hires a private investigator to look into her daughter's friend's family and keeps accusing her daughter's friend's mother as the anonymous caller. She has a family tree phobia because her stepmother included her family tree but excluded her mother's family, and the worst is she claims that maybe that was the cause of her mother's cancer. What? It's hard to accept.
- This story is too far-fetched, and Justine seems to be a psychotic woman, which I felt more lunatic than her victim. She has so many accusations and assumptions without solid proof. Actually, the entire story doesn't have anything concrete to convince me that the victim is the psychopath. Justine keeps accusing Anne of many things and is eager to kill Anne. Who would be so obsessed with their child's fictional story and relate it to her daughter's friend's mother? It's like she's too free and has nothing better to do, and let's accuse someone with loads of unproven things and force those into that person so she can have a game to play.
