# Escape: The True Story of the Only Westerner Ever to Escape from Thailand's Bangkok Hilton - David McMillan

## Personal Thoughts
David McMillan tells his story of living in Bangkok's prison after being caught smuggling drugs. Based on the book's title and the summary on Goodreads, I assumed the ending would be that he was able to escape prison to avoid the death penalty in Thailand.

>Among the 600 foreigners jailed in the 'Bangkok Hilton', one man resolves to do what no other has done: Escape. This is the true story of drug smuggler David McMillan's perilous break-out from Thailand's most notorious prison. After more than a year in jail and two weeks before a near-certain death sentence, McMillan escapes, never to be seen in Thailand again.

This book has been with me for a while, but I never got the chance to try to read it. I never expected this would be the first book to be abandoned this year, and it was just nine days after the new year. I really hate abandoning a book after reading it halfway. Unfortunately, I have too many books that I need to clear up, and I promise myself that I have to learn how to get rid of a book if I really can't delve into the writer's world. I also need to learn to crush the sense of guilt every time I can't finish a book.

I was thinking overnight whether I should give up, but I decided to give it another try on the next morning. So, I reached 22% of the book and finished Chapter 5, but I still couldn't get into the writer's mind. I read some other reviews about their reasons for discontinuing reading the book, and I found some were quite harsh. Maybe I was harsh in some past reviews, which I was never aware of. Anyway, my reasons are unrelated to his guilt or his English standard. 

For me, I just couldn't dive into his prison world. I wasn't expecting brilliant writing like investigative journalism or experienced writing with bold words and scene settings. I don't mind the simple writing, but it couldn't bring me into his world to understand the struggles and hardships in prison. Most of the time, I felt confused because there were so many things in his mind, and the story wasn't properly structured. He was telling the background story of some of the prisoners that he knew. Then, as the story progresses, the reader realises that those people he mentioned earlier weren't related to his escape plan or maybe just passengers in his life. I assumed the writer included those in the story because he knew someone probably had an interesting background. When the reader moves on from that, the writer offers some details about the escape, but after a few sentences, he probably bumps into someone, and the reader has to read another prisoner's story.
