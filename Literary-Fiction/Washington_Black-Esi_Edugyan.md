# Washington Black - Esi Edugyan

## Summary
### Part 1 - Faith Plantation, Barbados (1830)
- The narrator reflects about the time when his first master died. He was around ten or eleven years old. 
- The second master named Erasmus Wilde arrives after eighteen months. Rough men who are probably ex-soldiers or old slavers were brought in. The slaves were brutally tortured and branded a second time, leading to more killings and suicide.
- The narrator later reveals that he was born in 1818. He was a field slave and began working at the age of two. His first master named him George Washington Black, or Wash. 
- Christopher "Titch" Wilde is an explorer, inventor and abolitionist. He came to the sugar plantation to visit his brother, the owner of the plantation. Titch has chosen Wash as his personal servant to help him build the Cloud-cutter, an invention similar to a hot-air balloon.
- Titch later reveals that the narrator's first master, Richard Black, was his uncle, his mother's elder brother. Richard's estates came down to Erasmus, and he has to take the responsibility, as their father is a scientist who often travels for research.
- Titch's cousin, Philip, brings Wash along, and he commits suicide in front of Wash. 
- Titch decides to take Wash to flee away from the sugar plantation with Cloud-cutter before Wash is punished for Philip's death.
- Titch has to travel to the Arctic to find out the truth about his father's living state. He suggests Wash travel with the other two runaways to Upper Canada to be freed. Wash rejects the suggestion, as he prefers to travel to the Arctic with Titch.

## Personal Thoughts
- A thought-provoking and powerful story with beautiful words and prose. The layered narrative builds the compelling and multi-dimensional characters, which makes for an intriguing read and leaves a deep impression on readers. 
- The writer is an engaged storyteller. It has been quite some time since I read such an amazing story. 
- The past keeps pursuing Wash no matter where he goes. It's like a shadow that keeps following him. Wash never expects that Titch is also like him, running from his past.
