# The Cider House Rules - John Irving

## Summary
- Set during the 1920s. Homer Wells was born in an orphanage of a hospital at St. Cloud's, Maine.
- Homer comes back to St. Cloud's so many times after experiencing several foster homes that failed to accept him. The story continues with detailed accounts of several families who adopted Homer but later returned him to the orphanage, with each time having a strong reason for it. The orphanage is forced to accept Homer, who intends to make St. Cloud's his home.
- Homer runs away from his third foster family. It won't be easy for him to settle in a new family when Dr. Larch finds a new family after three years, by which time Homer is around twelve years old.
- Then, the story provides Wilbur's background starting from his childhood days throughout his medical journey as both obstetrician and abortionist. Wilbur's bad experience with a prostitute hired by his father and his parents' loveless marriage convinced him to choose a life of sexual abstinence. Wilbur becomes an obstetrician, but after encountering a case of mishandled abortion, he has a different view about abortion, which was a moral dilemma for him before this.
- When Homer reaches adolescence, Wilbur decides to take Homer as an apprentice to become a surgeon so Homer can take over Wilbur's work in the future.
- Wilbur loves Homer like a father to a son. Wilbur has to suppress his reluctance to let Homer leave St. Cloud's. He knew it would be more than two days, although Homer promised that it would be only two days.
- Homer enjoys his summer job at Ocean View Orchard as he experiences a more colourful life than his life at St. Cloud's. He is also facing a dilemma of whether to stay or return to the orphanage. He is in love with Candy, but at the same time, he misses Wilbur. He likes to work at the farm, but Wilbur wants Homer to become a doctor at St. Cloud's.

## Personal Thoughts
- I thought it would be a serious tone of writing style. I never expected the storytelling to be filled with wit and humour.
- It was an interesting read at the beginning as the story is written with humour and it's not difficult to read. The beginning is a deception to the darker themes and delves into more complex issues. I don't like the story because it's extremely draggy and none of the characters are likeable. I gave an extra rating star for the writing style (not the long-winded part). I really couldn't understand the popularity of this story, and I feel sorry that I really don't know how to appreciate it like others.
- The book is lengthy mostly due to the fact that of being overflooded with the details of the abortion procedures. I'm more interested in the story itself, which I guess the length of the book will be reduced a lot without every surgery's details.
- I don't know whether I would like Wilbur's character, who goes to the extent of creating a fake history of an orphan to protect his orphanage from hiring an assistant recommended by the trustee. He is also forcing Homer to become a doctor, which Homer has already clearly stated that he isn't interested in. All these acts are for the reason so that someone can take over his abortionist job, which is not supposed to be known outside of the orphanage.
- Most of the characters seem selfish and pin their hopes on the protagonist Homer to fulfil what they want for Homer's life. Wilbur wants Homer to take over his job as an abortionist and keeps forcing the belief in freedom of choice, although Homer is not comfortable killing a soul. Melony wants Homer to be her hero based on her imagination or fantasy but gets into a rage after Homer's life is not as "heroic" as what she hopes for. Candy wants Homer to follow her rules of keeping the secret of their relationship after Wally comes home from war.
- There are so many build-ups leading to the peak, but after it reaches the stage, the story never mentioned any follow-ups, such as the impact or consequences after that. It was draggy; the part of Candy and Homer wanting to reveal the truth to Wally and Angel, but when they reveal the secret to them, respectively, the story never mentioned anything about how Wally and Angel reacted after the revelation. Homer was so determined not to perform any abortions, which made the story quite lengthy. However, the reasons to change his mind were probably a few pages, which seem unconvincing and unbalanced.
- I felt relieved when I finished reading this book.
