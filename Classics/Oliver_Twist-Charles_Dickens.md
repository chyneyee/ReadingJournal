# Oliver Twist - Charles Dickens

## Summary
The story begins with an unknown woman giving birth to a child in a workhouse. The unknown woman later dies after childbirth, and the child, Oliver Twist, becomes an orphan. 

Oliver is sent to a workhouse or "child farm" with too many children and little food. On his ninth birthday, Mr. Bumble, a minor church officer, appears to escort him to a new home. Oliver is told by the board of the workhouse to pick oakum starting the following day. After several months under a small portion of food, the boys are desperate and hungry, and they hold a council meeting to choose a representative to demand extra food. Oliver is selected, and on that evening, he approaches the fat workhouse master and asks for more food. Oliver is sentenced to confinement by the board. The next morning, a notice is posted on the gate offering five pounds to anyone who will accept Oliver Twist as an apprentice.

The first attempt to send Oliver away to a chimney sweeper fails. Then, the parochial undertaker, Mr Sowerberry, is interested in taking Oliver on as an apprentice. After a month, Oliver becomes a formal apprentice and follows his master closely to several funerals. Noah, who also works for the undertaker, is jealous of Oliver and bullies him. Noah's taunting words cause Oliver to outburst into a violent rage, and he seized Noah's throat. Noah uses the opportunity to aggravate the situation and report it to Mrs. Sowerberry. Since Mr Sowerberry is not home, Mrs Sowerberry dispatches Noah to summon Mr Bumble. Mr Bumble believes Oliver's rebellion is caused by the leftover food given by Mrs Sowerberry, and it should be reduced to gruel or more starvation. Mr Sowerberry, who fears his wife, has to punish Oliver with a beating, which leads Oliver to walk away from the family.

Oliver decides to start a new life in London. During the journey, he meets Jack Dawkins (also known as The Artful Dodger), a boy of his own age who buys him food after observing his poor appearance. Oliver, who has no knowledge about London, is brought to a squalid neighbourhood by Jack to a Jewish villain called Fagin. The next day, Jack and another boy, Charley, come back from their pickpocket work and show Fagin what they got that morning. Fagin says they have to teach Oliver how to pick out the marks on the handkerchiefs with a needle. At this stage, Oliver still does not realise he has joined a band of pickpockets. Oliver's experience with the pickpockets is shortened when he is mistakenly caught for a crime he didn't commit. The accuser, Mr Brownlow, chooses not to charge Oliver and brings him home when he faints in court.

During Oliver's stay at Brownlow's house, Brownlow realises that Oliver resembles the woman in the painting in the house. This leads Brownlow to be more curious about Oliver's past. Meanwhile, Fagin is looking for any updates about Oliver's whereabouts before Oliver reveals to anyone about Fagin's crime. Nancy is sent to the police station and finds that Oliver has been taken to the Pentonville neighbourhood. Once the band knows Oliver's whereabouts, they forcefully drag him back to their house and claim that he is Nancy's brother, who recently ran away from his family.

After Oliver returns to the thieves' den, Fagin locks him up from early morning until late night. Fagin attempts to weaken Oliver by isolating him, thinking that Oliver eventually will be grateful and willing to do whatever Fagin wants.

One day, a dying woman, Old Sally, reveals a partial of Oliver's background to the widowed matron of the workhouse, Mrs Corney. Oliver's mother had given Sally a gold locket that might lead to people who would care for the child, but Sally had robbed her.

During the robbery attempt with Sikes's gang, Oliver is shot and abandoned by Sikes. When he regains consciousness, he walks feebly to look for help and ends up outside of the house that was the previous target of the robbery. Mrs Maylie, the owner of the big house with her niece Rose, has tremendous pity and compassion for Oliver after hearing his account of his past. With the doctor's help, they try to save Oliver from going to prison when the police investigate the robbery case. Oliver spends the next three months with the Maylies. His life changes dramatically, and he becomes a literate boy.

Meanwhile, Fagin's friend, Monks, is looking for Sally through Mr Bumble. Due to his greed, Mr Bumble reveals to Monks the existence of another woman who witnessed Sally's passing. Mrs Bumble negotiates with Monks for the information about Sally's death. With the agreed fee, Mrs Bumble reveals the story told by Sally before her last breath. She found a pawnbroker's ticket in Sally's hand, and the matron redeemed the pledge. Mrs Bumble gives Monk a small bag containing a small locket with two locks of hair and a plain gold wedding ring. The ring has the inscription "Agnes" with a blank for the last name, also a date within the year before Oliver's birth. Monks ties the locket to a weight and drops it into the river.

Monks comes to Fagin's house to meet him for an important update. Nancy eavesdrops on their conversation and learns that Monks is Oliver's brother. Monks intends to obtain a sum of money by hiding Oliver's identity. Nancy reveals what she heard to Rose and rejects Rose several times for her attempt to help her leave Sikes.

Coincidentally, at this time, Oliver finds out where Mr Brownlow is, and Rose brings Oliver to him after she tells the entire Oliver's account to Mr Brownlow. Without Oliver's knowledge, Rose, Mr Brownlow, Mrs Maylie and Dr Losberne are working together on how to proceed with Nancy's information.

Mr Brownlow has captured Monks and brought Monks to his home. Mr Brownlow was a good friend of Monks's father, Mr Leeford. Mr Leeford was a young man when his family forced him to marry a wealthy older woman. The couple later separated but did not divorce. The woman went to Paris with her son Edward (the actual name of Monks). Mr Leeford later fell in love with a retired naval officer's daughter, Agnes. Mr Leeford left a portrait of his beloved Agnes in Brownlow's care while travelling to Rome to claim his inheritance. After hearing the good fortune, his wife travelled with Edward to meet Mr Leeford there. Mr Leeford was later ill and died. Monks's mother burned Mr Leeford's will, took the newfound fortune to the West Indies and settled with her son there.

Rose is Agnes's sister, which means Oliver's aunt. She was adopted by a couple after her father died from heartbreak. However, Edward's mother was revengeful and tainted Rose's reputation, claiming that she was an illegitimate daughter. Luckily, Mrs Maylie took pity on her and adopted her.

## Personal Notes
- Poverty has no voice in society, and an orphan like Oliver Twist doesn't even have an identity. Mr. Bumble invented Oliver's name, and later in court, the officer invented a name for Oliver when he was too weak to talk.
- It was not easy to read, but I tried to grasp the meaning of those parts that I could understand and slowly dissected them.
- The storytelling is brilliant, although the writing style usually consists of multiple sub sentences in one sentence.
- Oliver is innately good but born into a bad environment.
- The contrasting life between the different socioeconomic statuses.
I liked the various combinations of personalities with socioeconomic status. Although Nancy is poor, she stands for what she believes is right and tries to protect Oliver from harm. Mrs Maylies and Rose come from wealthy backgrounds, but they do not possess any arrogance or prejudice due to their high society. They are tremendously kind towards Oliver and believe that his unfortunate poverty forced him to commit the crime. 
- Although Sikes is a robber, Nancy chooses to return to his side and rejects Rose's aid. Meanwhile, Rose rejects Harry's proposal because she doesn't want Harry's ambition as a politician to be affected by her background. Both Nancy and Sikes rely on each other for existence and survival. Rose and Harry don't have to depend on each other. With Rose's status, she has the ability to analyse and think of different perspectives whenever she handles any matters.
