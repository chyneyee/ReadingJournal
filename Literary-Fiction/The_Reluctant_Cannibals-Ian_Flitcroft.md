# The Reluctant Cannibals - Ian Flitcroft

## Storyline
The shadow faculty of gastronomic science has a list of rules to follow if you are a member of that secret society. The Faculty in St Jerome's College holds a gastronomic dinner in the eighth week of each term. Every member must invite one guest per dinner, and their guests must present a new dish to the Faculty.

The dinner hosted during the Trinity Term in 1969 ended with the sudden death of a Japanese diplomat during the dinner after he mishandled the puffer fish. The secret club continues indulging in exotic and forgotten culinary treasures, pushing their boundaries in devoting themselves to any food prepared with various methods and sophisticated ingredients.

Three months later, a new academic year, Michaelmas Term, started in October. Professor Arthur Plantagenet has a critical condition for his enlarged heart. During the menu-planning meeting, he tells his peers he does not have many days left. He wishes to donate his body to the science of gastronomy, inviting them to take the gastronomic adventure to the highest level by tasting a human.

After the death of Professor Arthur Plantagenet, his will stated the arrangement of donating a particular part of the body to the gastronomic science and part of the cremation ashes to be included in a specific meal. Will his other friends push their limits to delve into cannibalism by indulging their friend's flesh, or will they choose to break the wishes of the will?

Meanwhile, Dr Ridgeway, the vice-chancellor, has requested Augustus Bloom to meet him in his office. The recent death of a Japanese diplomat has led Dr Ridgeway to threaten to disband the secret dining society to avoid further reputation damage to the College.

## Personal Thoughts
- I loved reading anything about food, but I find the pace of this story is too slow for me. It can be boring sometimes, especially at the beginning of the story. The revelation of Arthur Plantagenet's wish of what to do with his body has slightly increased the interest. However, after that, the pace returns to slow and draggy. You just hope Arthur will die soon so you can know what will happen next.
- But after Arthur dies, you wish to know what his friends will do with Arthur's will, but the story drags all the way to the end.
- The unusual vocabulary can be slightly tricky for me. It was well-written, with meticulous details and accurate wording, but unfortunately, I'm not up to that level. It's rich with gastronomy history and culture but sometimes can be overwhelmed and push the main plot aside. The side stories have too many irrelevant descriptions, and the main plot has been dragged to the end. The pace is too slow, which is why I'm struggling to finish the book despite it being an unusual story.
