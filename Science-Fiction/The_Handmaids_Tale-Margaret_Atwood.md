# The Handmaid's Tale (The Handmaid's Tale #1) - Margaret Atwood

## Summary
* The narrator, Offred, begins describing her surroundings, where she and other girls are living in a confined environment which used to be a gymnasium. They are only allowed to go out for a walk twice daily within a limited area and only in twos to serve as spies for each other.
* Then, the story explains the hierarchy of the women under the current government and later reveals to the readers that she is living in the Republic of Gilead. The narrator also compares the current life with the past, which had more freedom despite being under protection by the authority.
* Pregnant women don't have to go out or go shopping. They could stay at home, but Janine chooses to go out to show off to other Handmaids. She is protected by Guardian soldiers in case someone tries to harm her due to jealousy.
* In Gilead, state and religion are inseparable. The official language used many biblical terms.
* The entire story switches between Offred remembering her free life before the suspension of the US Constitution and the current life under the totalitarian and theonomic state.
* Handmaids exist to bear the children of their Commanders.
* As a Handmaid, Offred has to spend most of her time alone without friends and family. She has to eat dinner apart from the rest of the household, and her bath time is regulated as well. 
* Offred remembers her daughter was taken away from her when she tried to escape with her daughter.
* Offred makes a metaphor that she is being taken care of like a prize pig. She no longer has any control over her body, and her only function is childbearing.
* The Bible reading by the Commander, which involves the citation of an ancient authority to justify the use of Handmaids. 
* The assassination of the President and the killing of the members of Congress leading to the suspension of the Constitution. It was supposed to be temporary, and elections should be held, but the excuse was it needs time for the preparation. Things are building up without their knowledge, such as newspaper censorship, the appearance of roadblocks, a crackdown on pornography and prostitution, kids disappearing when on the way to school, and women losing jobs and their bank accounts being transferred to their husbands or closest male family member.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

* Serena, the Commander's wife, asks Offred whether there's a sign of pregnancy. Offred says there isn't any, and Serena reminds her that the time is running out. She suggests that probably the Commander is sterile or infertile. She comes up with an idea to set Offred up with Nick, their driver. If Offred agrees, Serena will let her see the photo of her daughter.
* Offred keeps going back to Nick after the first arrangement. She longed for human touch and even telling more of her personal things to him. The forbidden relationship continues, and Offred begins to feel more accepting of this new totalitarian world.
* The public execution and later the new Ofglen's revelation of the old Ofglen's suicide have shaken Offred and led her to go back to the obedient life. Offred decides to accept the fate. Later, Serena tells Offred that she knew the betrayal when she found the winter cloak and sequin outfit that Offred wore to the club.
* A van comes to get Offred, which initially she thought was because Serena reported her to the authority (the Eyes). Nick tells Offred that it's safe for her to go with them because Nick is both a member of the Eyes and also a member of an underground resistance movement, Mayday. The ending didn't mention whether Offred is being rescued or going to prison.

## Personal Thoughts
* Explores the political oppression of women and uses religion as an excuse to control women's bodies and reproductive rights. Women are forbidden to read so that the authorities can easily control women in all aspects, including their minds.
* Handmaids are punished by beating their hands or feet if they commit offences because those parts are not essential for the purpose of reproduction.
* I think the writer has brilliantly captured the stagnant life of a Handmaid who is soulless and filled with loneliness but eager for a real relationship. The monotonous life which is stuck in time, confined in an environment with a lack of proper human interactions and freedom, but what remains is an abundance of vague past memories.
* No build-up of thrills, and even when the writer suddenly drops a bomb of a development for one of the characters, I couldn't feel any plot twist or shock about it.
* The ending without a closure made me feel like I'm reading for nothing. I already didn't feel the story was appealing, and I was hoping at least I would get to know what will happen to Offgred. Unfortunately, there is no clarification or a proper ending. It's one of those endings which I hate the most – open-ended and up for the readers to speculate how they want.
