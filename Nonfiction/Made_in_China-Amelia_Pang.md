# Made in China: A Prisoner, an SOS Letter, and the Hidden Cost of America's Cheap Goods - Amelia Pang

## Summary
* Set in Portland in 2012, Julie was looking for some Halloween decorations for Katie, her five-year-old daughter's birthday. She found an unopened package given by her relative.
* There was a note found inside the package. The note was written in broken English by the prisoner who had made and packaged the items. The note mentioned the inhumane working conditions and the targeted group as prisoners. The letter was one of many SOS messages written by various prisoners across China which could be found from some major retail stores.
* The narrative brings us to Shenyang, China, in 2009, three years before the letter was discovered. Sun Yi, a forty-two-year-old man, is one of the detainees who works fifteen- to twenty-hour shifts for various goods which are exported from China to the United States and Europe.
* The repercussions of the Cultural Revolution have led current mainland Chinese to prioritise societal stability over human rights.
* Falun Gong was initially supported by the Chinese government until a fee dispute between two parties. The government wants to have full control over the group's members. When Falun Gong distanced itself from the government qigong association, the party saw it as a threat because the party lost control of a group with seventy million followers who were inclined to launch a democracy movement. The group's action led to the widespread anti-Falun Gong propaganda from state-run news networks to uproot the potential threat and to avoid the history of political unrest.
* Some fundamentalist followers of the practice refuse medical treatment, which the party uses as a reason to ban the group to protect people.
* The Chinese government did not offer alternatives to help people leave what was supposedly a life-threatening cult. Instead, the Chinese government put them in prisons and labour camps.
* Falun Gong followers morph from advocacy for religious freedom into a resistance movement.Â 
* Sun imprisoned for his beliefs and political activism.
* Chinese manufacturers believe they have no choice but to covertly outsource to gulags due to the need from consumers throughout the world for low pricing and the newest trends. Low-priced merchandise leads to landfills when discarded within a few years of production.
* In China, forced labour has existed for hundreds of years. Every year, Laogai camps produce income that boosts the local economy.
* Auditors cannot determine whether a factory is secretly sourcing from labour camps.
* Sun Yi's journey from Falun Gong practitioner to prisoner of conscience is described in full in the book, along with the details of his struggle for survival and freedom in the forced labour camp.

## Personal Thoughts
* A letter from Masanjia discovered in Portland led to the enquiry into its origin, including the author's history as a prisoner and the history of Chinese labour camps.
* Other discussions included in the book are low production cost to meet the growing demands due to fast fashion, consumers' ethics, the conditions of women's camps being worse than men's, and other survivors of forced labour sharing their stories.
* Insightful and a lot to ponder on.
