## The Seven Mysteries of Fudo High
* On the northern side of the school building, there is a staircase kept closed to the public. A long time ago, a student suddenly started to count the number of steps when walking down the staircase. When he reached the thirteenth step, he fell dead. 
* There is a biology room at the old school building. A female student was changing a broken lightbulb, and she placed a small candle besides her. Suddenly, she lost her balance. When the teacher came in to check for her, he found her dead. Since then, mysterious things started to happen. One night during a power cut, a teacher had to light a candle in the biology room and saw the hanging body. When the power recovered, the body disappeared in front of him. Since then, nobody has entered the biology room, and it is closed to the public.
* One of the rooms in the old school building was a printing room. One day, one of the students had a bad accident, and his hand got severed. He died from excessive blood loss. Later, the students and teachers couldn't find the severed hand. Since then, the room has had the sound of a male student sobbing on rainy days, and his hand is still around the school. 
* There was a student who committed suicide by hanging himself on the tree because he was being bullied. Since then, if anyone walks past the tree at night, they can see the ghostly figure of a boy hanging on that tree.
* A male student was crushed to death by the statue of a goddess in the school.
* A female student fell into the well, and her blood caused the water to turn red.

## Storyline (Potential Spoiler)
The headmaster receives the fifth threatening letter after the board of directors of the school decided to demolish the old wooden building at the northern side and rebuild a new one over it. The unknown sender with the name 'Afterschool Magician' stated that seven curses will be brought upon the school if the old building is destroyed.

Hajime and Miyuki join the crime novel club after Makato challenges Hajime's intellectual level in mystery literature. Ryoko asks the members to investigate the myth of the seven mysteries related to the dead student and also the identity of the 'Afterschool Magician'.

Ruiko is reading the seven mysteries in the old school building until night. Suddenly, the building is shaking. She seems to have found the solution behind the seven mysteries and calls Hajime to come to the old school building. A mysterious figure appears behind her with a rope in his hands.

<br>

<b>First Case</b>

Ruiko is missing when Hajime and Miyuki arrive at the school. The other members come after receiving a call from a weird male voice telling them that there will be a death ritual at 10 pm in the sealed biology classroom.

When Hajime and the caretaker are looking for Ruiko, they see a light come from the biology room. They even see Ruiko's hanging corpse in the biology room and a mysterious masked figure besides her. They quickly break into the room, but Ruiko's hanging body has disappeared. 

The next day, when Hajime arrives at school, he sees Ruiko's corpse hanging by the neck exactly as he had seen it the night before. 

<br>

<b>Second Case</b>

Hajime and Miyuki found a line of unknown codes left by Ruiko and printed it out to decipher it. When Takahiro sees the code on the screen, he tries to crack the code. He gets hit by a mallet wrapped in cloth by someone who he knew while working on the code.  The school finds his hanging corpse from the tree the next day. The biology room's key was stuffed into his mouth. 

<br>

<b>Third Case</b>

Miyuki goes to the old printing room to print the unknown code after she lost it in the library. A mysterious figure attacks her from behind using something similar to a mallet.

<summary>The Details</summary>

- Ruiko's killing occurred in the physics room. The killer uses a mirror as a reflection to create an illusion in the biology room. The candles are used as the source of light to avoid the mirror's reflection.
- The physics teacher, Yuichiro Matoba, is the killer. He killed Ruiko when he heard she called Hajime to say that she found the secret of the six mysteries. He worried that he would get exposed, so he strangled her from behind.
- A long time ago, the current location of Fudo High School was used by a pharmaceutical company as a lab to test new drugs. The company hired six people for the drug testing, but the experiment failed, and the six people died. The old school building became a new lab, and the company hid the six men in that building. Later, the company closed the building down and donated the building to Fudo High School. One of the researchers, Yuichiro, who used to work for the pharmaceutical company, came to teach at school. He created the six mysteries and spread them among the students to prevent people from coming near the six sites.
- The missing student, Chihiro, found the truth of the six bodies in the school ten years ago. She was murdered before she was able to reveal the truth. Yuichiro hid her body in the old school building and created the seventh mystery.
- The earthquake a few nights back messed up the room of the mystery club and revealed the dead body. Ruiko figured out and typed the secret message before being killed. The code needs to be decoded into Romanji mode, which reveals the truth of the hidden bones in the wall.
- Takahiro was hanged on the wrong tree, and Miyuki was placed near the well instead of drowning like in the original story. The reason is to avoid leaving the bodies too close to the actual location of the seven mysteries.
- Takahiro got killed because he mentioned that he wanted to bring a better poster to replace Makoto's poster. Yuichiro attacked Miyuki because she wanted to take down Makoto's poster. The poster covered Yuichiro's secret. Hajime tears down the poster, which reveals a skull, after Yuichiro denies his crime.
- Yuichiro tells the story of Chihiro finding out about the bodies and also his identity as a researcher. He tried to convince her not to report to the police. Then, she lost her balance and fell from the staircase. 
- Suddenly, Ryozo lunges at Yuichiro and stabs him with a knife. Ryozo is Chihiro's father. He joins the school as a security guard to investigate his daughter's death. Yuichiro is dead before the ambulance arrives.

## Personal Thoughts
This case is more straightforward than the previous case, the Snow Yaksha Legend Murder Case. The story is easier to read because the flow goes in sequence. It's also less complicated because all the murders happened at one place.
