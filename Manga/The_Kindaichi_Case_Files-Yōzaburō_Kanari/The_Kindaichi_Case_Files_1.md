## Storyline (Potential Spoiler)
Nine members of the Drama Club travel to a private island for the training in preparation for the National High School Drama Contest. Miyuki asks Hajime to come along to help the club to work on the sound effects after three members unexpectedly quit before the contest. The training camp is on an isolated island which only has three people living there, including the owner himself. The hotel has a theatre for them to rehearse the play.

During the dinner, Orie is missing, and everyone goes to look for her. They heard a woman's scream and the ring of the theatre's bell. Hajime and Miyuki go to the theatre and find Orie is dead. Hajime finds that the wire's end appears to have been cut with a knife and suspects that Orie was murdered. Someone cut the wire, and the lights fell on top of Orie. They try to find Kagetsu, the mysterious guest, but his room is in a mess. The bathroom's wall is written with a few words from the play. Then, they find out that the boat breaks free of the dock after someone cut the rope. The twelve guests and two staff members at the hotel are stranded on the island with a murderer.

Later, Harumi is found dead hanging on a tree. Referring to the classic "locked room" mystery, Hajime suspects Harumi was dragged out from the room and hanged on a tree. At this stage, there is only one set of footprints leading from Harumi's window, and they found her shoe, which matches the footprint. On the same day, they find the props are ruined and the phantom's mask wardrobe is missing. Miyuki realises that the methods used to kill the victims are similar to the play.

Ogata finds the murder weapon at the theatre and suspects someone who she knows as a murderer. Later, she is found in a bathtub in a sea of bloody water. Hajime finds out that Ogata still has fake nails on her fingers, which are supposed to be taken off if she plans to take a bath. The murder is different from the play, which was supposed to be a drowning. Hajime feels that Ogata's death is a mistake by the murderer and deduces that Ogata probably knows who the murderer is. 

Ryoko receives a threatening letter from the Phantom. She reveals that on the night of Fuyuko's accident, she, Orie, and Harumi had called Fuyuko to the science lab. They were jealous of Fuyuko for getting the main role and planned to play a prank on her, but the prank turned into an accident. The detective and Hajime arrive on time to save Ryoko and Miyuki when the Phantom appears. They try to chase after the Phantom. It appears he climbed out the window and jumped from the cliff. The mask is floating on the ocean. Everyone assumes the killer has died, but Kindaichi disagrees.

The following morning, Hajime gathers everyone at the dining room. He explains how the murders happened.

<summary>The Ending</summary>

* The murderer checked in to the hotel the day before they arrived by the name "Kagetsu". He asked the staff not to disturb him and used a rubber boat to get off the island. The murderer later came back to the island, and "Kagetsu" is just a fake name. 
* The murderer recorded Orie's screaming sound during the rehearsal. He got her to meet on stage to talk about the truth of Fuyuko's accident. He played the recorded sound on the speaker to lure everyone to run to the theatre. The murderer left the dining room pretending to look for Orie, but actually, he went to cover the scream by ringing the intermission bell. Orie was killed when the curtain on the stage was down, which hid the sound on the speaker. Then, the murderer cut the wire for the lighting to fall on her, reopened the curtain, and joined the group at the murder scene. 
* The murderer left the reel in the sound room because it's too troublesome to take the reel along. When he went back to retrieve it, Ogata was there and found the reel, which forced him to kill her. The blood was on the curtain, and Ogata's nail was found in the sound room.
* The murderer faked the death of Kagetsu.
* Hajime predicts the fourth murder plans to happen in the dining room with a trap. Arimori suddenly falls off the chair. Hajime reveals the killer is Arimori, who has combined the missing crossbow and clock to launch an arrow to kill Ryoko. Hajime secretly changed Arimori's watch to trap him back. He even made Arimori sit at Ryoko's assigned seat before that.
* On the night of Harumi's death, Arimori made a phone call from Orie's vacant room. A wire had been circling outside of Harumi's window. When Harumi poked her head out from the window, Arimori pulled the wire to strangle her. After killing her, Arimori used the wire to get down to Harumi's room. He wore Harumi's shoes when carrying the dead body and walked to the tree. He put the shoes back on her while he walked on the grass, leaving no footprints.
* When they were chasing Arimori or the Phantom, he threw away the cloak and the mask into the ocean. The window ledge is clean. So, it means Phantom is still alive, although everyone is assuming he jumped into the ocean.
* Arimori takes Ryoko as a hostage. He reveals that he and Fuyuko are going to get married, and he knew the truth about the accident in the science lab. Then, one night at the hospital, they heard the conversation among the three girls. The three girls didn't show any appreciation of Fuyuko keeping the truth. Fuyuko committed suicide the following night, which led Arimori to avenge her death. Arimori misunderstood Fuyuko's last words, assuming she wanted revenge. 
* When Hajime explains the real meaning of Fuyuko's words, Arimori feels it's too late after he finally understands the meaning. He let go of Ryoko and was killed by the trap that he set before. Arimori died in the end.
* The detective finds out Arimori was living alone after his parents divorced. He also found an unopened note left behind by Fuyuko. The note is a suicide note, asking Arimori to forgive the girls so he and she can go to heaven together.

### Other Details
* Before Fuyuko jumped from the hospital's roof, she removed the bandage and said the same words from the script. She said that she is the "Phantom of the Opera" and the ugliest creature on earth. 
* Hajime points out that nobody sees the mystery guest, and only Mr Kurosawa mentioned the stranger's appearance.
* Four years ago, Mr Korosawa's daughter committed suicide by taking poison. She was in the drama club. Her boyfriend left her for the other actress. The play was "The Phantom of the Opera".
