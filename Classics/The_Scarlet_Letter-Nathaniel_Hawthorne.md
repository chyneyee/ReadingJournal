# The Scarlet Letter - Nathaniel Hawthorne

## The Custom House - Introductory
- The narrator, who shares a background similar to the author's, tells his story of how the book 'The Scarlet Letter' was written.
- Based in Salem, the narrator works in the Custom House as chief executive officer. The narrator finds the building is dilapidated and no longer as busy as the older days.
- Most of the fellow workers are elderly and frail. They are not only inefficient but also repetitive with their old sea stories. 
- One rainy day, the narrator discovers several documents in the building’s unoccupied second story. The small package contains the works of Jonathan Pue, Surveyor of His Majesty's Customs for the port of Salem, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The package also consists of a gold-embroidered piece of cloth in the shape of the letter “A.” The narrator examines the scarlet badge and holds it briefly to his chest, but he drops it because it seems to burn him. He then reads the manuscript. The manuscript is a record of the life of Hester Prynne which occurred in the 17th century. 
- When a new president is elected, the narrator loses his politically appointed job. He settles down and begins to write a fictional account of Hester Prynne.

## Summary
- The story begins with the scene where a crowd of gloomy-looking people has gathered outside the door of a prison in the seventeenth century in Boston.
- The women in the crowd make disparaging comments about Hester Prynne as the crowd watches Hester emerge from the prison door and walk towards a scaffold. She steps into the open air while holding a baby of a few months old. On the breast of her gown is embroidered with the letter "A" stitched in gold and scarlet. Based on the crowd's harsh contempt for her, we can deduce that Hester has borne an illegitimate child and the letter "A" stands for "Adulterer". She couldn't believe her current fate after reminiscing about the past.
- In the crowd that surrounds the scaffold, Hester suddenly spots a twisted, stooped, deformed shoulders old man. She recognises that the man is her husband, who sent her to America but never fulfilled his promise to follow her. Hester's husband asks a local in the crowd about Hester’s crime and punishment, explaining that he has been held captive by Native Americans and has just arrived in Boston. The local man tells him that Hester is the wife of a learned Englishman and had been living with him in Amsterdam when he decided to emigrate to America. The learned man sent Hester to America first and remained behind to settle his affairs, but he never joined Hester in Boston. Hester's husband asks the stranger about the father of Hester's baby, The stranger tells him that Hester refuses to reveal the sinner. As punishment, she has been sentenced to three hours on the scaffold and a lifetime of wearing the scarlet letter on her chest. 
- Reverend Dimmesdale, a young clergyman is delegated to demand that Hester reveal the name of her child’s father. He tells her that she should not protect the man’s identity but Hester strongly refuses to reveal the name. Reverend Wilson delivers the condemnatory sermon and Hester is brought back into the prison.
- Hester meets her husband, Roger Chillingworth face to face who provides medical assistance to her in the prison. He offers her a cup of medicine which she initially refuses as she thinks it might be poisonous. He assures her that he wants her to be alive to be burnt with shame. He blames her lover for their humiliations and asks her for the name of her lover but she refuses to tell him. He makes her promise not to reveal his identity either and implies that he plans to seek out her unknown lover.
- After a few months, Hester is released from the prison. She lives in an abandoned cabin and remains secluded from others. However, she can support herself due to her exceptional skill in needlework. Her beautiful embroidery was worn in various official ceremonies and even funerals except weddings. Hester feels lonely and seeks companionship and sympathy but to no avail. 
- Hester's daughter, Pearl is a constant reminder of the punishment of her sin, but also a consolation. Pearl's ostracism by the community especially the cruelty from other children leads her to create her own imaginary world. Pearl develops a curiosity about the scarlet letter which feels like torture for Hester.
- Reverend Dimmesdale has been suffering from severe health problems. Chillingworth lives with Dimmesdale so he can diagnose and cure the young man. Chillingworth tries various methods to cure Dimmesdale but the health is not improving. Then, one day, when Dimmesdale falls asleep on his chair, Chillingworth pushes aside the vest that Dimmesdale is wearing. On Dimmesdale's chest, Chillingworth finds the answer he has been seeking for all this time.

## Personal Thoughts
- Long introduction of the Custom House before the beginning of the main story.
- Hypocrisy of powerful men in judging others which they have no right to judge but understood that it was based on the older time.
- The writer has a beautiful poetic style to describe the miserable life of Hester Prynne. It touches the heart of the readers and garnered my sympathy but unfortunately, the locals are ruthless to her.
- Unfamiliar with the old writing style and ancient words but couldn't deny the sympathy evoked by the writer's storytelling.
- The struggle between individual identity and social identity remains an important theme.
- I love the part when Pearl questions his father's warmth and kindness to them only at night or in the quiet forest but during the day, they have to pretend that they are not as close as they are supposed to be.
- It's a great story to depict the difference between a person who suffers the guilt silently and another who suffers externally from the public condemnation. It also shows a person who hides his sin shares an equivalent suffering as someone's sin who has been openly exposed. Both have different heroism in certain perspectives. Hester accepts her fate and takes responsibility for her sin courageously. Her partner who seems like a coward and hypocritical but is tormented by his own sin all this time, finally has gained peace after his brave confession. Unfortunately, the judgment is harsher on Hester than her partner due to status differences.
