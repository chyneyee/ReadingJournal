# The Colorado Kid - Stephen King

## Summary
Stephanie has been working for The Weekly Islander newspaper for three months. She is now living in Moose-Lookit Island. Her two senior colleagues, Dave and Vince tell Stephanie an unsolved case that happened in the 80s. A young couple found a man sitting dead on Hammock Beach with his back against a litter basket. The initial investigation was the man died of choking or stroke and they couldn't determine which one came first. After several months passed, a former rookie cop called Dave and told him to investigate the state stamp on the cigarette packet that was collected from the man's shirt. The man has no identification and because the cigarette packet is stamped with the word "Colorado", the man is identified as 'Colorado Kid'.

## Personal Thoughts
It's not a long story, but for the sake of chasing away the guy from the Globe to get any news from the locals, it is considered a lengthy one. The story itself is mysterious and intriguing to read, but having the old men telling the story seems ruined the story's interest.
