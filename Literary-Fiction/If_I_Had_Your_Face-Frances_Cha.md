# If I Had Your Face - Frances Cha

## Storyline
This story revolves around four young Korean women with different backgrounds and ambitions to survive in Korea's realistic and materialistic world.

Sujin, an orphan, is obsessed with her looks and envies Kyuri, who lives above them in the apartment building. She will do whatever it takes to make herself beautiful, even living in a heavy debt life. Ara, her supportive friend since middle school, is her flatmate and hairstylist. She lost her voice caused by a violent fight which is later revealed at the end of the book. Ara is a big fan of Taein, a member of one of the K-pop boybands. She is obsessed with him and hopeful she can meet him one day. However, when the opportunity comes, it might not turn out as what she has been fantasising about all this time.

Kyuri had multiple altercations on her face and works as a room salon girl at Ajax, the most expensive room salon in Nonhyeon. She is a realistic and proud woman who couldn't tolerate the ugliness or normality of other women. Her hard-earned status at an exclusive room salon is threatened when her impulsive action leads by curiosity and interest in one of her clients. Kyuri has a flatmate, Miho, who returned from New York after finishing her studies. She is different from Kyuri as she doesn't care about her looks and has neither makeup nor plastic surgery. She has a wealthy boyfriend from a chaebol family. However, Miho struggles to adapt to his family's upper social class even after being together for many years. 

Meanwhile, Wonna is the only married woman that lives in the same officetel as the others. She has a traumatic childhood, from having an abusive grandmother to accidentally causing blindness in her cousin. She also reveals why she married her husband and is not because of love. When she is pregnant, she and her husband have no idea how they will afford to raise a child in such high living cost conditions. Besides the affordability issue, Wonna's pregnancy could pose a risk to her job security.

## Personal Thoughts
I immediately liked the story when I started reading it because it was filled with Korean culture and stereotypes such as K-dramas, room salons, social status, and plastic surgeries. The story's beginning has directly raised some of the significant social issues in Korea, which are probably overlooked by the outside world under the shadow of K-pop and K-drama waves. 

I feel it's infrequent that a writer has the ability to write in different styles based on the various characters. A writer usually tells a story of varying characters but maintains the same writing style. Frances Cha possesses multiple writing styles depending on the characters. Ara seems innocent and a supportive friend. When it comes to Kyuri, the tone is more arrogant, materialistic and very hostess-like.

It's very realistic when the writer brings up the issues of men and the workplace when a female employee is pregnant. Maybe it rarely happens in Western countries, but in Asian countries, being pregnant has to come along with other anxieties, such as living costs and not losing the job. Most companies can't afford employees' absence for a long time and piling workload on others. Also, unlike in Western countries, most new mothers don't have ludicrous benefits and long maternity leaves. 

I loved the ending, but I can't explain why. It may still be considered a happy ending or the best for everyone.
