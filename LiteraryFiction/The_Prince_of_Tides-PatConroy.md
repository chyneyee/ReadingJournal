# Storyline
The narrator begins with his childhood story of growing up in the blazing South Carolina heat, from catching crabs to fishing in the river. Melrose Island was an uncleared island the narrator's great-great-grandfather won in a horseshoe game. It was passed down through three generations until it came to his father by default. 

The narrator has been running away from his past and trying to forget his childhood life, especially his parent's divorce. It drags him back to his forgotten history when he visited Savannah in a mental hospital after her second suicide attempt. 

One afternoon, Tom receives a call from his mother, Lila, whom he intensely despised of. Lila comes to the house with the tragic news about Tom's sister Savannah. Savannah tried to kill herself again the week before. She's in a psychiatric hospital in New York City. Tom decides to leave for New York to see his sister. His mother's visit ends with sarcasm and some exchange of verbal attacks about his joblessness before she leaves.

Tom lashes his anger at his mother and can't understand why there is so much hate in their relationship. Sallie tells him to move on with his life instead of being bitter and self-pitying after what happened to Luke. Then, the conversation turns into another sad news for Tom when Sallie tells him she's having an affair with her colleague. She feels distant and unloved since Luke's incident, which led to the affair. What happened to Luke caused Tom to hate, blame himself, and shut himself down from others.

Tom arrives in New York full of criticism of the environment and people. It brings back the memories of when her sister left South Carolina and how she loves New York, which is difficult for Tom to understand. Savannah became a successful poet and published her first book in the 1970s. Both Tom and Luke were so proud of her, and nine years ago, they came to New York to attend her reading. Tom witnessed Savannah's hallucination issue on the last night in New York. She told them before that she had been seeing a psychiatrist all this time as she still had difficulties moving on due to their family's history.

After knowing Savannah's condition and Luke's perception of Savannah's mental health, Tom can't find the answer to why it happened to Savannah and begins questioning his role in the family. Luke is the eldest and protects the rest to safety while facing his father's violence alone. Luke probably has his own wound despite never understanding Savannah's state of mind. Savannah is the youngest and probably the most vulnerable among them, which is why she never had sufficient strength to cope with the tragedy compared to her two brothers. Looking back at his life, he lived as a mediocre man with a normal life. 

Dr Lowenstein is Savannah's psychiatrist. She wants to get the details of Savannah's history so they can help her, but the usual Tom just responds with sarcastic answers. At this stage, I'm getting more disliking Tom. Initially, I felt he has a weird personality, like trying to have some sense of humour, but the jokes aren't funny. He's very self-centred and overly proud of where he belongs but despises everyone that possesses better things than him. At the same time, he seems inferior and tries to use jokes to hide the other side of him.

Instead of telling Savannah's story, Tom decides to tell his own story to Dr Lowenstein to save himself. He tells the story of his father as a war pilot, and the day his mother gave birth to him and Savannah amid the heavy storm. His life in New York, trying to help Savannah with Dr Lowenstein, is interwoven with the stories of his childhood that slowly reveal the father's violence and detailed accounts of other family members. 

Dr Lowenstein is married to a rich violinist. She is a lonely woman who has marriage issues with her husband and communication problems with her teenage son. She hires Tom to become her son's football coach while Tom stays in New York, trying to help his sister with his family stories. As they spend more time together, Dr Lowenstein falls in love with Tom while Tom struggles with his marriage and identity.


# Personal Opinions
I wonder how many younger generations can accept such a writing style. It has racial issues, which I assumed historically, American white southerners were more racist? It's just my assumption since I'm not an American, but I can dig on the Internet to learn more. I think the sexist jokes probably can be too far at this time. 

The writing style and descriptions are superbly beautiful. It has an expansive vocabulary, and I gave up looking for the meanings unless necessary. Although beautifully written, it can be long-winded and crowded with superfluous details. I ignore the bigotry jokes (due to the geographical history and publishing year) so that it does not contribute to my rating. It's a solid story that reflects the author's life. 

I strongly dislike the main character Tom because he has full of unfunny jokes, self-pity, and is an egotistical person. In fact, there are no loveable characters in this story, and Luke probably is the only one that can be slightly more acceptable than others. I feel Savannah is very observant and sees more things than others in the family. It's a family tragedy, or according to Savannah in the story, it's a very screwed-up family. Both Luke and Savannah are fighters but not Tom.

I'm very conflicted and in a dilemma in rating this book. It's a good story if ignoring the racist and sexist jokes plus long-winded details, which deserves a 4 out of 5. But I don't like wordy books, and I don't like most of the characters, especially Tom. Maybe it's 3.5 out of 5?
