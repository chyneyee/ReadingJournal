# A Dead Body Never Lies - Rohayu Binti Shahar Adnan & Fatin Amin

## Summary
This book consists of ten cases with the timeline from when Dr Rohayu worked as a forensic pathologist in Kuala Lumpur and Johor. It begins with photos of autopsy equipment which are unusual but interesting. 

When reading the beginning of the book, I was surprised at how angry Dr Rohayu was with the police's inefficiency and the scattering of rubbish on the beach. I thought the writing style would be purely a description of the case. At that time, I thought having emotions instead of pure facts would make reading less dull. Besides the detailed explanation for each case, it also includes photos that I wish would be in colours for easier to see.

I liked the writer tried to simplify the explanation with examples so the readers could easily understand the scientific terms. It's packed with compelling cases with photos and insightful analysis about it.

## Personal Thoughts
Sometimes, the analysis can go too far out of the scope. I understand the doctor has personal opinions, but the content would be better if the main focus were the case and lesser inclusive of her views. I feel it was a bit personal when she included some of her religious beliefs in the cases. 

I found there were times the opinions could be too blunt or judgmental towards the deceased. I would prefer she keeps those opinions to herself. She was angry with people who didn't seek medical assistance, which I understand from her perspective. At the same time, we had no idea what the deceased's thoughts were, why the deceased didn't ask for help or whether the deceased knew how or where to ask for help. We can't think like them or assume they are as rational or logical as some of us. We don't always understand how some people think. I hope I won't get a scolding from the doctor if I say those to her.

Her vast knowledge and experience are undeniable. I wish I don't need to know her personal opinions or assumptions about the deceased's thoughts and decisions when they were alive. We should just leave the deceased alone instead of making a lot of speculations. It's already happened, and we can do nothing to rewind what happened. Why do we still need to speculate or criticise the deceased's decisions?

The writing style is the slightest concern because I understand I'm not reading a novel. I don't need to read something to be written stylishly. My only struggle with this book was the doctor's tremendous opinions and criticism of almost every deceased. It's upsetting because it's already miserable reading about a death regardless what the reasons, and then, I have to read the harsh words from the doctor about what she thought and what the deceased should do when they were alive. If she wanted to give her advice or educate others, the writing didn't help to express herself well. The content also can be repetitive, too many irrelevant details of her personal life, repetition of how she needs to do her job, grateful for others, how hard to get information from other departments, how she had given justice to the deceased or a voice for the dead, and her judgements not clouded by emotions.

Aside from that, I really respect her courage to pursue such an admirable profession. I admire her extensive knowledge, and she seems a person that I would like to listen to when she gives a detailed explanation of a case. Unfortunately, the writing really puts me off. I tried to be accepting, but the repetition and too many of her long-winded personal opinions and criticism made me hard to like this book entirely.
