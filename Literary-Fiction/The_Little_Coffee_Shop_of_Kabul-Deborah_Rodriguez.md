## Personal Thoughts
I like the story includes Ahmet's perspective about the women he encounters in his workplace. It's good to see how a traditionalist views the various women who come from different backgrounds and cultures.

The story was alright and somehow quite interesting at the beginning. As the story progressed further, I realised the reason why I started to feel bored, and the pace seemed to be slower. The story is getting lengthy, with irrelevant details that are not obvious at first. The writer suddenly wants to include every detail, such as paint shopping, Christmas shopping, excessive sentimentalism about the past and their origin country, and the repetition of UN missions in the country. I thought this book was literary fiction, but the writing style is more like a cozy mystery or romance writing style.

In summary, the story is about a bunch of foreigners in Afghanistan who are overly ambitious and filled with pride to change a country that they don't belong. It makes them look naive and simple-minded, and sometimes, the story tries to highlight the influences and privileges of foreigners and how helpless the locals are. At the same time, it's also a story of five different women's relationships in Afghanistan.

What ruins the story even further is the love triangle between Sunny, Jack, and Tommy. If I knew this was a romance story, I wouldn't pick this book. The writing about Sunny is disappointing because it portrays her as a woman who is desperate for love and sex. Actually, that's how it looks like for every foreign woman in this story. I've never read a story that has the writing style with such a huge gender disparity. In this story, the men's perspectives are written exceptionally well, but the women's characters are poorly written.
