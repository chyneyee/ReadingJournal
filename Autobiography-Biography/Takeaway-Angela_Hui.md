# Takeaway: Stories from a Childhood Behind the Counter - Angela Hui

## Summary
This memoir is about a Chinese takeaway, Lucky Star, in rural Wales, written by the owners' daughter, Angela Hui, who grew up with it since the 1990s. In 2018, Angela's parents decided to sell Lucky Star after 30 years in business.

Chinese takeaways began in the post-war years at the beginning of the 1950s. Its popularity peaked in the 1970s, and shops opened at a rate of three a week. 

The story begins with Angela briefly explaining how Angela's parents left post-war Hong Kong in 1985 for a better life. The family moved around a few places, settling in Beddau, Wales, and opened their own Chinese takeaway. The whole family, including her brothers, lived above the takeaway and seldom left the building.

Angela was spot on in explaining the life of an Asian living in a white community. Most Asian cultures indeed quietly ignore inappropriate comments, stay silent, and let the abuse slip under the radar. Asians constantly remind themselves to be the 'model minority' and keep working without complaints.

The storytelling is raw and authentic from the beginning. The struggles are expressed very well in the book. Although my family neither has a takeaway shop nor lives in the white community, I can still relate to the difficulties of being an Asian as a minority and various emotional conflicts as a child brought up in a conservative family. The story itself is refreshing, as there are not many, and this is probably the first memoir about Chinese takeaway. It offers various perspectives from the other side, which customers like us probably visit the shop and leave without thinking about the hard work in the kitchen.

I'm not surprised if someone will make this story into a movie someday.

- Clashing two different worlds - The world of being yourself at your own age and another world with no margin of error and being treated as an adult by family.
- Casual racism, which most people don't realise and probably uncared for.
- Lots of ups and downs throughout life as a takeaway family.
- Stressful and pressure takeaway business, torn between personal life and family obligation.

## Personal Thoughts
- Truly reflects the mindset of Asian parents and the angsty of an Asian child. There are a lot of upsets and unhappy feelings that bubble up inside. You have no one to talk to because Asian parents don't lay out the problems or express their feelings, and it's weird if children are doing so. Sometimes, it's like walking through a minefield when doing things for your parents or even living your life based on your choices because you don't know whether it's up to their standards. You won't get praise or any simple appreciation if you did great work, but if it fails to meet their requirements, always be mindful that there are consequences you need to bear.
