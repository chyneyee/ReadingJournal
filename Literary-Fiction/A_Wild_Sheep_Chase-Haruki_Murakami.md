### Part 4 - A Wild Sheep Chase, I
- "We can, if we so choose, wander aimlessly over the continent of the arbitrary. Rootless as some winged seed blown about on a serendipitous spring breeze."

### Part 5 - Letters from the Rat and Assorted Reminiscences

<br>

### Part 6 - A Wild Sheep Chase, II
- The man discusses the photo of a specific sheep that appears among a herd of sheep, starting with the history of sheep in Japan, leading to the reason that the particular sheep shouldn't exist in the country. The sheep has a distinguished feature, which is a star-shaped birthmark.
- The man tells a long story about his boss, who is in a coma at that time. The story slowly leads to the reason for his interest in that particular sheep. It requests the narrator to seek that sheep within two months but later reduces it to a month. Failure to find the sheep will cause the narrator's company to end, and probably his life as well.
