# Cycle of the Werewolf - Stephen King

## Storyline
Tarker's Mills is choked with snow by a January blizzard. Arnie Westrum, flagman on the GS&WM Railroad, is in a shack, waiting for the storm to die. Besides the strong wind, he hears scratches at the door. Before he knows what to do with the unknown visitor, a big wolf strikes the door. Arnie screams after trying to hit it with a pick. Something more murderous than a wolf has arrived in Tarker's Mills, and the cycle of the werewolf has begun.

The month of February is about Stella Randolph's Valentine's Day. It's a full moon in cold blue light. While she is still in her dreamy state, she expects the unknown visitor to be a man when she hears scratches at the window. She opens the window, and it's too late to remember Arnie Westrum being torn apart in the railroad shack a month ago.

March - Blizzard with heavy, wet snow. <br>
One night, Tarker's Mills is in darkness due to a power failure caused by the heavy storm. Some villagers hear the howling, and the next day, a drifter is found in a frozen pool of blood and wolf prints around him.

April - Showers of rain and starting to green up. <br>
Spring is coming. The moon grows far for the third time that year. Brady Kincaid, eleven years old, has lost track of time playing with his kite. The daylight is fading with a bloated and orange moon. A sudden roar causes Brady Kincaid to scream, and the wolf runs toward him.

May<br>
The town is getting unsettling. Reverend Lowe has a nightmare about his congregation turning into werewolves. The next morning after the full moon, he finds a gutted body of Clyde Corliss at the church's pulpit.

June<br>
Alfie Knopfler, the owner of Tarker's Mills' only cafe, never expects his regular customer's physical appearance is slowly shifting, which he relates to the show his nephew used to watch, The Incredible Hulk.

The story is told with the cycle of the werewolf begins in January and ends in December. Each chapter has a beautiful illustration depicting the scene of Tarker's Mills that month. Every month, there is a story of different victims of the werewolf.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>
  
- Marty is the only survivor who has seen what the werewolf looks like. When he goes trick-and-treating on Halloween Night, he knows who the werewolf is. The man is wearing an eyepatch. He finds a similarity in this man's human face to the snarling face of the animal he saw four months ago. It took him almost sixty days after returning from Vermont to discover the werewolf's identity. The man with an eyepatch who dropped a Chunky bar is the Reverend Lester Lowe of the Grace Baptist Church.
- Rev Lester received a letter in childish handwriting. Inside the letter, the sentence is - "Why don't you kill yourself?". Then he starts to feel something is not right about him when he reflects on his nightmare and his body condition, which relates to the moon. Other unexplainable things include muddy and torn clothes, unknown scratches and bruises. He receives a series of notes indicating someone knows his identity.
- Rev Lester drives to Portland, but Milt Sturmfuller, a lifelong resident of Tarker's Mills, becomes his victim there. Milt Sturmfuller is staying in the same motel with his mistress. The next day when Rev Lester reads the newspaper and finds out about the death of Milt Sturmfuller, he thinks it is Lord's will and that Milt Sturmfuller was not a good man.
- On New Year's Eve, Marty equips himself with a gun with two silver bullets after asking for help from Uncle Al. He tells Uncle Al that he believes Rev Lester is the werewolf. Marty had sent a few anonymous notes before revealing his identity. When the werewolf comes to Marty's house that night, Marty fires the gun and kills the werewolf, which gradually changes to Reverend Lester Lowe.
