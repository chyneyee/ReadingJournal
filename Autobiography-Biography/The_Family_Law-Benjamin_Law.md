# The Family Law - Benjamin Law

# Summary
Benjamin recalls his childhood memories growing up in an Asian household in Australia. He bares his soul and tells everything about the life of his immigrant family, and even some stories which I felt quite personal to him. Besides communication issues and the generation gap with his parents, he also shares some eccentric and funny stories about them and his four other siblings. It's amusing, witty, and probably too revealing for some readers.
