# Crime and Punishment - Fyodor Dostoevsky

## Summary
This story consists of six parts, beginning with the crime being committed in the first part, but the punishment spans from the second part until the end. The story begins with the protagonist's visit to Alyona, the pawnbroker, for the final survey before he executes his killing plan, but he is entangled in a dilemma between justice and morality. Raskolnikov believes that Alyona should be killed for the good of all, but there are times he feels hesitant about the absurd idea due to his conscience. However, when the opportunity comes, Raskolnikov takes the chance and commits the murder. Due to the deterioration of his mental state, there is no specific reason to explain why he commits the murder. The mental torment and the physical pain immediately serve as the punishment for his crime.

## Personal Thoughts
* Raskolnikov and Marmeladov both share some similarities in that both men are depressed due to the poverty, but at the same time, they continuously linger with their depression while the women around them have to work to support the family. Despite the fact that they disagree with the women's actions most of the time, they continue bathing themselves in their bitterness in their own space while criticising their family's actions for financial support, and the worst is they even use the money earned from the criticised action.
* That is a heartbeat-stopping moment for the scene when Raskolnikov wis still in the house after the murder and two visitors come to look for Alyona for business. Only the door divides the visitors and him.
* The murder is neither motivated by greed nor the desire to help people because he never checks on the stolen items or thinks of selling them after he takes them.
* Throughout the entire storyline, Raskolnikov possesses two different personalities: one is compassionate, and the other is seeing himself above the others.
* Raskolnikov isn't well from the beginning, but the burden of his crime and the fear of being caught, which drains his energy due to overthinking, adds more severity to his illness.Â 
* I found the writer brilliantly captured the rollercoaster of emotions of the protagonist.
* The colourful cast of characters with varying moral compasses offers a well-balanced story that also influences the protagonist's mind and decision-making.
* Raskolnikov's inner world is filled with fear, doubts, and second-guessing, which is the main focus of the story. Dostoevsky highlights how the murder forces Raskolnikov to deal with tormenting guilt and not the legal punishment. Raskolnikov's being punished with the stress and anxiety of trying to avoid punishment is more severe than the actual punishment.
