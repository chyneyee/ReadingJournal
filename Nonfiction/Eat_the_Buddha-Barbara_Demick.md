# Eat the Buddha: Life and Death in a Tibetan Town - Barbara Demick

## Summary


### Part One: 1958 - 1976
- For centuries until the coming of the Communist Party, Ngaba was ruled by its own kings and queens. Gonpo was raised as a princess and was born in 1950. Her father was the fourteenth in a line of rulers in the Mei kingdom. The servants were packing when she and her mother returned from her uncle's funeral. The house was being sealed with tape and a cordon of soldiers outside the house the next day. The whole family was brought away by a jeep.
- The history of the Mei kingdom. Queens tended to outshine their kings.
- Kirti opened a branch of the monastery in Ngaba and eventually became one of the most influential, politically active and reputational for rebelliousness.
- During the clash between China's forces (Kuomintang) and the Communists in 1934, the Communists fled farther and reached Sichuan province. The Chinese soldiers were short of equipment, food, and local knowledge. They knew nothing about the Tibetan plateau. They picked crops from Tibetan fields and captured sheep and yaks for slaughter. Despite the Communists leaving IOUs after they looted Tibetan larders, there was a limit to how much food could be raised. For the first time, Tibetans experienced famine conditions. 
- The Chinese later discovered that the Buddhist monasteries contained potential comestibles such as drums made of animal skins, and they are figurines sculpted out of barley flour and butter. It was a votive offering according to Tibetans. 
- The queen enlisted the able-bodied men to fight, blocking the advance of the Red Army near Tsenyi monastery. Nearly half of the Chinese regiment of 1300 soldiers perished. The Red Army scoured the grounds for abandoned properties, digging for hidden valuables, picking bare the fields, and taking over the vacated premises. They chose the assembly hall of Kirti Monastery, tore up the floorboards, stripped the walls and melted the copper bowls and silver statues for their necessities. 
- The Tibetans fled into the mountains and stayed for about four months. In 1936, the Red Army came back and they fled again into the mountains.
- Due to the British invasion of Tibet from 1903 to 1904, Mao vowed to protect the western flank of his nation by establishing firm Chinese control over Tibet. In 1950, some 40,000 People's Liberation Army troops captured the border town of Chamdo and forced the Tibetan Army to surrender. Tibet was ruled by the 14th Dalai Lama who was just fifteen at that time. The appointment of a head of state through reincarnation is one of the defects in Tibet's theocratic system of government.
- 1951, signing of the Seventeen-Point Agreement with the promise that the religious beliefs, customs, and habits of the Tibetan people should be respected in exchange for their loyalty.
- In 1956, the Communists started to confiscate land in parts of Sichuan province.
- In 1958, the king was summoned to Barkham, the capital of the prefecture for an urgent meeting. The army seized his palace and escorted his family away from Ngaba while the king was out of town. 
- "Democratic Reforms" - The Communists tried to convert the Tibetans and loot the wealthy families. Violence was widespread and food was scarce.
- Tensions between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama are escalating. The Tibetans suspected that they would arrest the Dalai Lama and they vowed to protect him. On March 17, 1959, Dalai Lama dressed in layman's clothing and with a small retinue of family members and aides made his way on horseback out of Lhasa and into exile in India.
- Gonpo's family went through the Cultural Revolution. Her mother disappeared and her father jumped off the bridge due to the mother's disappearance. Gonpo has been through struggle sessions and was later exiled to the remote area to become hard labour.
- In 1969, Gonpo arrived in Xinjiang. Gonpo married Xiao Tu in 1976.
- On September 9, 1976, Mao died.

### Part Two: Interregnum, 1976 - 1989
- Rebuild of monasteries and some monks returned to their old life.
- Modernisation and economic growth especially in traditional herbs.
- Tibet's development attracts the Chinese to set up their business there and even take over Tibetans' land for their own benefit.
- Tsegyam who was a teacher and probably the most educated person in Ngaba became an activist due to his support of the Dalai Lama. He later ended up working for the Tibetan exile and eventually becoming the Dalai Lama's private secretary.
- Gonpo was in exile again when she and her daughter reached India to meet the Dalai Lama. After the Tiananmen Square massacre, the era of tolerance came to an end.

### Part Three: 1990 - 2013
- Random lives in Tibet. More land grabbing from China.
- 2008 protest before the Olympics.
- Tightened the control after the protest, surveillance cameras installed, oppression, restrained freedom.
- A series of self-immolation incidents despite the government setting a harsher punishment for the offenders.

<br>

### Part Four: 2014 to the present
- Gonpo met Dalai Lama. She thought it would be a short separation from her husband and the youngest daughter. It was sixteen years before she saw them.
- Tibetans strive for freedom to preserve their culture, memories, and language, both inside and outside China.

## Personal Notes
I don't understand why their religion needs to be taken away after the Tibetans have pledged their loyalty? Why the force to take Buddhism away from them? I can see the situation only becoming worse because of impatience and force. Anyone can say whatever the authorities want them to say but the authorities can't control what is inside someone's mind. I really don't see the benefit of using force in any situation.
