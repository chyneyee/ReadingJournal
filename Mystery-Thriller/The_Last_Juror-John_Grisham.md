# The Last Juror - John Grisham

## Summary
- In 1970, The Ford County Times went bankrupt. The owner and her son, who is also the editor, are both too old and have their problems, respectively, to manage the paper. The creditors chase after the son for the money. The Times was a great paper, but later it filled with obituaries and less advertising, which led to bankruptcy. 
- Willie, a 23-year-old college dropout, decides to buy the paper by borrowing money from his wealthy grandmother and becomes the editor and owner. The new owner is Joyner William Traynor. He grew up in Memphis, was educated, and aspired to become an investigative journalist.
- Willie remembers the brutality of Rhoda Kassellaw's murder, which increases the paper's sales.
- Rhoda met Danny in a dance club. Danny couldn't accept Rhoda's rejection. He knows where Rhoda lives and hides behind the wardrobe in her room before he sexually assaults her. Rhoda later finds out who the attacker is. She tells her neighbour, Mr Deece, about Danny Padgitt before she dies.
- The Padgitts are a wealthy and influential family who live on their island. They owned the Sheriffs of Ford County for generations. For decades, the family operated various illegal businesses, but not a single Padgitt was ever indicted for a drug-related offence. Then, Danny Padgitt was arrested for the rape and murder of Rhoda Kasselaw.
- The Times takes the opportunity to report and publish every detail of the murder case. The subscriptions jumped, and the ad revenues doubled. Willie wants every truth to be out despite his staff being worried about the consequences since the Padgitts are influential and dangerous.
- Padgitts openly threatens to kill every jury if he is convicted.
- The jury couldn't reach the unanimous votes for the death penalty. The judge has to sentence Danny to life imprisonment. In Mississippi, a life sentence doesn't mean life imprisonment. The offender will become parole eligible after serving ten years.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>
  
- Danny has been placed in a satellite prison near the small town of Broomfield. The satellite prison is for non-violent offenders to reduce the overcrowding at Parchman.
- Willie makes the news as a headline, which leads to Danny being reassigned back to Parchman.
- Danny gets a parole hearing, but Willie, who acts as a witness and provides his statement, causes the denial of parole.
- After one year since the first parole got denied, Danny is paroled from the prison. It had been nine years since he got convicted. 
- Two jurors are shot and killed. The two dead jurors coincidentally had voted against the death penalty for Danny.
- When an explosion occurs on the third jury who voted against the death penalty, the police decide to arrest Danny. 
- During the bail trial in the court, Danny is shot and killed by Hank Hooten, who was a lawyer. He was admitted to a mental hospital a few years ago after he openly fired his gun at the town.
- Hank had a schizophrenia history. He was in love with Rhoda, and her murder was traumatic to him. His mental state got worse when the jury refused to send her killer to death.

## Personal Thoughts
- Interesting reading about Mississippi's history of school desegregation.
- I think the main plot about the Padgitts and his revenge probably consists of 30 per cent of the story. The rest are random stories about racial and political issues in the town. Surprisingly, I quite enjoyed reading those, although usually I dislike too much irrelevancy in a story.
- If you are looking for something thrilling or tense to read, this story is probably not what you expect. However, if you are looking for casual or light reading with a subtle thrill, this would be a good one.
