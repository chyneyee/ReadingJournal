# Crooked Seeds - Karen Jennings

## Storyline
There are five parts in this book. The introduction begins with Deidre van Deventer, a fifty-three-year-old, unemployed amputee, living in a poor condition to the extent of using dishwashing liquid to clean herself and clothes with the water she got from the water truck. Then, the story shifts to Deidre's mother, Trudy, with the fragments of memories of her beloved son, Ross. The story later reveals Deidre lost a leg when one of the bombs detonated at her former home when she was around eighteen. Ross built the bombs with the intention to blow up voting centres during the 1994 elections. He ran away after the explosion.

Back to present life, the police have unearthed three bodies at Deidre's old house. The entire story focuses on Deidre's selfish life, using her disability to her advantage and also thinking the whole world has been unfair to her. The police questioned Deidre about the bodies and her brother and his involvement with a pro-apartheid group in the 1990s.

The story tries to portray that Deidre is an ignorant and selfish woman who doesn't care about anything in the world except her life. As the story progresses, she can't run away from the past and decides to confront the dark history of her family.

## Personal Thoughts
Deidre is using her disability as an excuse for everything, including being selfish. 

There is something intriguing that made me continue reading and wonder where this story is heading, although the writing style is not really straightforward. The switching timelines between the present day in a drought-stricken Cape Town and flashbacks to the 90s, plus Trudy's state of mind, were really confusing to read. 

Despite the existence of deeper meanings behind the story, unfortunately, I felt confused from the beginning until the end of it. I couldn't grasp the themes until I'd read some other resources or reviews on the Internet after I finished the book.
