# Falling into Place - Amy Zhang

## Summary
Liz Emerson died after running her Mercedes off the road. It was also the day when she studied Newton's Laws of Motion in physics class.

Her mother Monica listens to her voicemails and only knows about the accident when claiming the baggage at the airport. Julia receives a phone call from the hospital about the accident because Liz's emergency contact is her father's house number. 

Kennie is on a bus with her school's dance team. She's excited about the dancing competition and travelling in the opposite direction when her best friend Liz is in severe condition after the accident. 

The story travels back to five months before the crash to give us more insights about the planned accident and giving up on staying alive. In between, the story keeps us updated with Liz's current condition at the emergency room which doesn't look optimistic.

Then, it shifted to three weeks before the crash. Liz has been a loner since her father passed away and her mother travels a lot for her work. She loves to drink and parties but also struggles with bulimia. She begins to think of suicide and plans to end her life with her own rules. 

Besides revisiting Liz's life before the crash, the storyline offers us to look into her best friends' lives, Kennie and Julia when they were together with Liz.  We also get to know a schoolmate who has been secretly in love with Liz without her knowledge and they neither are friends. I think this is a great inclusion. Sometimes, we question whether our death will have any impact and how much it will affect our family and friends. We seldom delve further into whether any unknown to us will be impacted by our deaths. 

From revisiting the days or months before the accident, the story progresses to what happens when Liz is in the hospital and she's on the verge of dying. Teachers are prepared with what to say to the distraught students. Some teachers are in tears and probably some feel relieved that their classes no longer caused nuisance by Liz. Some teachers feel guilty for failing to see the other side of Liz.

We always argue and sometimes put blame on others when something doesn't go well for us. Then we feel regret with the argument when bad things happen to that person. It never comes to our mind what if that person has been secretly burdened with guilt but he or she doesn't how to help us? I think this entire story leads us to delve deeper into various perspectives of human inner feelings that we usually ignore because our feelings are always the most important. Julia gets addicted to drugs because of Liz. Liz never admits it's her fault for Julia's addiction but actually, Liz is in immense guilt but she doesn't know how to help Julia. She knew she had caused trouble in many people's lives which made her contemplate suicide.

She seems lost throughout her teenage life especially after her father passed away. She is popular and surrounded by friends but it doesn't cure her loneliness. She becomes a bully and mean but she has no answers to most of her misbehaviors. She needs help but she doesn't know where and how to get it.

## Personal Thoughts
It was a good read at first. Then, as it progresses further, I feel directionless and repetitive. It's like in real life. The repetitive guilt leads us nowhere. I feel slightly disappointed because the story itself offers a lot of meaningful things that we can learn and think about our lives but the writing style is messy and repetitive. I understand this is the writer's debut novel. It wasn't a bad story but the writing style is not my cup of tea. I think if the story had a more organised timeline and less repetition, it would be a more enjoyable read.
