# Invisible Girl - Lisa Jewell

## Summary
When Saffyre Maddox was ten years old, something terrible happened to her, causing her to start hurting herself. Her uncle Aaron took her to her GP and referred her to a therapist called Roan Fours.

Meanwhile, Roan has a fifteen-year-old daughter named Georgia and a fourteen-year-old son named Josh. They are under temporary accommodation after their home, which was a mile away, was damaged by subsidence. Georgia, who returns home late one night, was spooked by a man who walked so close behind her. She accuses the man who followed her of being the one who lives in the house opposite them. The following night, her friend Tilly is assaulted not long after she leaves their flat. Although later Tilly admits that the assault was a lie, Roan's wife, Cate, is sceptical about it. She is curious about the man who lives in the house across the road, and her unsettled feelings lead her to dig for more information on the Internet about the house.

The story is slowly introducing the strained relationship between Roan and Cate, which happened one year ago. Roan had no affairs, but Cate was suspicious and followed Saffyre even after knowing that Roan was innocent.

Saffyre had a few therapy sessions with Roan when she was ten years old. After Roan terminates the sessions, Saffyre, still not used to the sudden ending of her routine, walks to the Portman Centre and unexpectedly finds another Roan's secret.

The story moves to a new character, Owen, which indicates that he is the man who lives opposite the Roans and is labelled as a "creepy guy" by Georgia. Owen lives with his aunt and teaches Computer Science at a school. He is a lonely man who hates women but is eager to have a girlfriend. Due to recent complaints from a couple of female students, he is suspended from work while the school is investigating him.

On Valentine's night, Saffyre goes missing opposite Owen's house.

## Personal Thoughts
I don't want to say at first, but I couldn't control myself to feel how annoying Cate is. I knew Roan had an affair a long time back, but her suspicions and anxiety are over the top. Her curiosity is so extreme that she even challenges her husband's professionalism and wishes to know everything about his patient, Saffyre.

On the other hand, I'm very impressed with the other side of Josh. The conversation with Saffyre really changed my perspective about him. Every character was written with in-depth details of their personality. I really feel bad for Owen. There is nothing wrong with being different or fear of women. He probably lacks confidence or feels inferior when talking to women. He's just living his own life, and society is judging and biased against him.
