# Hide - Kiersten White

## Summary
Mack lives in a shelter and is being offered an opportunity to participate in a hide-and-seek tournament with a chance to win fifty thousand dollars. Mack is confident she can beat all the competitors and win the money. After all, her hiding skill is the one that keeps her alive while her family isn't.

Fourteen competitors. Seven days. It has divided into two groups - aspiring and stalled. A thirty-minute hiding window is given at the start of each day, which is dawn. The gameplay continues until dusk. At dusk, everyone leaves their hiding spots and returns to base camp for their evening meal and sleep. Every day, two contestants will be eliminated.

<b>Aspiring:</b>
* A social media fitness model (Jayden)
* A graffiti artist (Atrius)
* A YouTube prank-show host (Sydney)
* An app developer-slash-house sitter (Logan)
* A jewellery designer-slash-dog walker (Rosie)
* A zealous CrossFit instructor ("beautiful" Ava)
* An actress with severe food allergies (Rebecca)
<br>

<b>Stalled:</b>
* A writer with severe people allergies (Ian)
* A boy equal parts banished and lost (LeGrand)
* The kindest gas station attendant in Pocatello, Idaho (Brandon)
* A veteran (Ava)
* A solar panel salesman (Christian)
* An eternal intern (Isabella)
* And Mack, who is nobody if she has her way
<br>

The story includes the narration of every participant with their life story and what motivates them to join the competition. 

An intern, Isabella, hopes to be hired by the technology company that organised the competition. Logan, an app developer, also shares the same ambition as the intern. Sydney, a YouTube prank show host, hopes to develop an app with Logan.

LeGrand comes from Zion Mountain, and his father is a prophet. He was banished from the family for trying to get a doctor for his sick sister. Brandon, who works in a gas station, has a kind heart and is gullible enough to share everything with anyone and assume others feel the same about him.

Jaden is a selfish contestant who sabotages another contestant for his own advantage. He is eager to be loved and idolised by others after feeling abandoned by his mother before he finishes high school and after several past breakups.

## Personal Notes
- I'm struggling with the slow pace, but at the same time, I really want to know what happens in the end.
- An overdue excitement only arrives when the competition has fewer than five survivors. The story keeps shifting different characters with their background and disappearance. The entire story focuses on Mack, her thoughts, and her past, which helps her survive the competition.
- Towards the end, I realised one of the reasons for my struggle is because there are so many emotions, feelings and thoughts of every character throughout the story. It keeps coming, but it's repetitive. Some of those are irrelevant and should move on and focus on the main story.
- Generations of seven families track down their distant relatives every seven years for sacrifices for the prosperity of the families and their founded town.
- This legacy and the involved families are so screwed up with their twisted minds.
