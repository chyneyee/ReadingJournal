# Discontent - Beatriz Serrano

## Summary
* The narrator begins her story by describing her boring working life, such as pretending to be a different person throughout a video call with a team in the office. She appears to be interested in the meeting, knowing what questions to ask to appear attentive and what to say to pass the time without actually doing anything.
* The narrator, Marisa, is 32 years old, working in advertising for eight years, four at the current agency.
* Marisa assigns her project to the master's students. She enjoys watching YouTube videos while working and delegated some of the tasks to her assistant.
* As the story unfolds, she reveals how she hates her job and her coworkers and even wishes to be hit by a car so she may go on disability. The agency is filled with a psychopathic boss, unrealistic demands from the management, and overenthusiastic colleagues who revel in their exploitation, making Marisa feel depressed and empty inside.
* Marisa adopts multiple personalities, playing different roles every day in the office. She is trying to cope with her anxiety pills.  Marisa is pushed to her limits when she is forced to participate in a team-building retreat, especially when she is given an unexpected task.

## Personal Thoughts
* I agreed that team building is an idiotic idea which wastes time and money.
* She sounds lonely and depressed with her mundane working life. She seems trapped in a situation where she has nowhere to go and doesn't even know where to go.
* I think the story was well-written to portray someone who lost her passion in her job after so many years and also the sense of being trapped in a familiar but uncomfortable zone.
* The story is tolerable until the narrator meets her old friend, which heightens the feminism element in this book. I thought it was only about workplace life and occasional stories about the difficulties that women experienced in the workplace, but I started to feel uncomfortable when it was getting too heavy with personal anger against men.
* Interesting. After all, comedy and satire are the main themes. I never imagined such an ending.Â 
* Overall, there were many aspects discussed in the novel that were quite relevant to actual life. Some of them provide valuable lessons about the modern work life. The only part that my interest was slightly affected by was the hatred towards men. What she highlighted about the gender inequality in the workplace is spot on, but I was worried the story would be filled with continuous criticism against men in general. Luckily, it was a brief part about it.
