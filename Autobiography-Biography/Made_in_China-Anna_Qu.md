# Made in China: A Memoir of Love and Labour - Anna Qu

## Summary
- A memoir written by Anna, who worked in her family's garment factory in Queens when she was a teenager and offers a glimpse into the daily life of a garment worker who works ceaselessly on menial tasks in the factory.
- Anna shares the story of her childhood about her father's death and the distant relationship with her mother. She was left with her grandparents in China when her mother went to America. When later Anna was brought to America, she was introduced to her stepfather and half-siblings. In America, she struggles to adapt to the new environment, and the loneliness results from the family's treatment, especially from her mother.
- She was treated more as a maid than as a daughter or part of the family. Later, Anna was sent back to China to live with a retired couple, parents of one of the factory workers. When she returned to America after several months, she was treated even harsher than before. She was invisible to them and worked longer hours in the factory. The stress of dealing with the family's animosity forced her to speak with the school counsellor.
- She initially believed that the call to Child Services had improved her life until later years, when she discovered that the truth was not what she had expected all along.

## Personal Thoughts
- I couldn't help but think that the mother was probably proud of her new status and luxurious lifestyle, and wished to ignore the existence of her eldest child, who was a continuous reminder of her previous life. I don't know if she was embarrassed with her life before the second marriage or if she doesn't want others to know that she had a previous marriage and a child. I couldn't understand why she had to take her daughter to America if she was so eager to forget her past marriage. Perhaps she wanted to avoid being criticised for abandoning her own child.
- Treating her own daughter as a maid sounds terrible to me, or maybe she's too stingy to rehire a maid, but the ultimate blow was when she asked her daughter to call her Aunty in public.
- The writer has been searching for answers to all of the unsolved questions about their relationship. It's not surprising that she's been looking for reasons why she's being treated differently, and she will continue to wonder if it's due to her mother's upbringing. Did something terrible happen to her mother in the past that shaped her into the person she is today? If I were her, I would also want to know the answer.
- Towards the ending, the writing style appears different than before. It tends to be more emotional, or maybe the writer is outraged after discovering the truth and needs somewhere to vent. The abrupt ending suggests that the author was at a loss for how to end the book because her relationship with her mother remained distant, so she got another family member involved to end the book.
