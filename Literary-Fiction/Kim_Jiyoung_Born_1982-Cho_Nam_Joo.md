# Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 - Cho Nam-Joo, Jamie Chang (Translator)

## Storyline
Wow. That was a creepy beginning for the story. At the same time, I feel sad for Jiyoung because something must have happened that pushed her to such a delusional state. I'm glad that her husband treats her well.

It begins with Kim Jiyoung's childhood, which started in 1982. All the good things will be given to her younger brother, while any remaining will be shared with her sister. She has no jealousy or the thought of her brother's special treatment but believes they are generous siblings.

The story continues to different stages of life, and every stage is disadvantageous towards women. At work, higher management is all men and promotions and salary increments are also given to men. Then, the pressure from family and relatives to have a child after marriage leads the couple to have a baby earlier than planned or unplanned. Jiyoung's entire life is on the line, including her youth, job, colleagues, social networks, career plans and future. It's challenging and expensive for childcare if she is also working, and she will have to sacrifice her career to take care of their child.

The ending not only briefly summarises what happened to Jiyoung after a series of strange behaviours but also offers a different view from a psychiatrist of what he thinks about working mothers. Despite all the considerate thoughts about Jiyoung and his wife, he still prefers unmarried women in the workplace.

## Personal Thoughts
- It's upsetting when reading the part where most women need to work and sacrifice their talents for their male siblings. It's unfortunate that the women would never know how talented or intelligent they are, same as men for those women. They had no choice due to patriarchal norms. 
- Bits and pieces of a woman's life that most people had overlooked the gender disparity as it becomes a norm that passes through several generations.
- Sometimes, when I reflect back on my past, I don't realise some of the issues are gender-based issues until someone else points out the problems later on in their lives. To be honest, this story is very realistic and related to reality.
- The misogynist level is unbearable. The lewd jokes and their casual sexist comments are intolerable. They just can't think beyond their gender perspective.
