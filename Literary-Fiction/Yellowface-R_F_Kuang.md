# Yellowface - R.F. Kuang

## Summary
* Athena Liu is a successful writer. She has no friends except the narrator, June Hayward. June is also a writer, but unfortunately, her works aren't as successful as Athena's.
* June recognises Athena's talent but also believes that other reasons for Athena's success are because she is beautiful, educated, and Asian. 
* Athena and June are always hanging out together, but there isn't any bonding between them. She assumes the continuous friendship exists due to her lack of threat to Athena's career.
* When Athena suddenly dies in an unusual manner, June steals her unpublished manuscript and publishes it as her own under the name Juniper Song. She is living Athena's life and has everything she ever wanted.
* June fends off all the criticism, especially targeting a white writer like her who wrote a book involving Chinese history.
* When suspicions are floating around about the authenticity of the story, June begins her battle with the world to protect her reputation and the dark secret.

## Personal Thoughts
- I think the writer has brilliantly portrayed the protagonist, June, who has been jealous of Athena and turns into a selfish person who acts for her benefit without any remorse.
- When I read the part about the changes to the manuscript, especially the Chinese characters for the names and also the terms for family members, I'm looking forward to the trouble that will fall on her.
- I liked the tension build-ups throughout the story. It feels like walking on a tightrope. The readers keep wondering when and how June will get exposed.
- The writer puts a realistic criticism in the story about June's work. June is defending herself when one of the readers criticised that "Chinese soldiers wouldn't have eaten foods like mince pies for a holiday meal." I find it hilarious and realistic. The first thing that comes to my mind is steamed buns. Mince pie seems a bit too Western, and I find it amusing how June defends herself for using "minced pie".
- I feel greed and arrogance kill June's career. She is too calculative, bitter and vengeful.
- An intriguing read. It makes the readers delve into the cruel reality of the competitive industry.
- I hate stories with no ending, but surprisingly, I have no disappointment or anger when I finish reading it. The only thing that annoys me is that June never repents until the end. It's not that I expect or hope she will become a better person; that will affect my opinions about the story. I'm just flabbergasted that after all the terrible things that happened to her, she was still able to twist truth and shift the blame to others.
