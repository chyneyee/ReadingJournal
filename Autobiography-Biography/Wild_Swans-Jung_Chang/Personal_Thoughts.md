# Personal Thoughts

Women's lives during olden times were extremely tough. It's distressing to read about Yu-fang and her mother, who had no choice or right to decide their fates. I think it's not fair to despise or bias against concubines at that time. After all, it's not that they have a say in their marriages. 

Bao Qin (De-hong) was extraordinarily courageous and admirable. Her life in the political party, especially after marriage, was despairing. She neither had any support and understanding from her comrades nor her husband. It's hard to read when such a courageous woman was treated with a lack of care after marriage. Besides Dr Xia, with his courage to go against his family and give up his wealth for love, I found most men in the book hard to be respectable.

I don't have any particular feelings or hate about China. Occasionally, I feel perplexed by some of the Chinese government's policies and the people's mindset. But reading about the country's history, especially the famine and the Cultural Revolution period, I just feel how much they had endured to come this far and become one of the most successful and influential countries in the world. Nobody can deny the sweat and tears, the sufferings and hardships of their people who worked hard to build up their country into such powerful like right now. 

Before the Cultural Revolution, there were a series of unnecessary campaigns and great famine. Each time a campaign ended or the living condition turned into a better state with hope for stability and peace, another new campaign came. It's just constantly living in fear and enduring all these hardships due to politics.

Reading all those various forms of torture, I felt so disgusted with those torturers' minds. What's wrong with their brain? Some will probably say because of the pressure or any other reasons, their creativity in brutality was still inhumane and disgusting. And those women torturers were horrific as if something was so screwed up with their brains.

Although I didn't like Chang's father (Wang Yu), especially how he treated his wife, I profoundly sympathised with him during the Cultural Revolution. I don't know whether I should admire his character or feel restless with his stubbornness. One thing that I'm sure of is I really admire and respect the wife (Bao Qing). I loved her even more and admired her character of not denouncing her husband despite her husband treating her not as caring as other husbands treated their wives. I don't think many women can do that in these modern days if they have such a husband.

I sensed the transition of phases in Chang, changing tone from a loyalist to experiencing a dilemma between loyalty from what she had seen and heard to someone frustrated and tired of propaganda after the truth and her parents' experience.

Chang detailed her family's story, and the narration was written chronologically, which makes it easy to read.
