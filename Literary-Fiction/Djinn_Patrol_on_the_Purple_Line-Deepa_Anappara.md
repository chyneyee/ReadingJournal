# Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line - Deepa Anappara

## Summary
The book begins with a mystical story about a person named Mental who helps poor kids working at the railway station by collecting plastic bottles. After his death, he is idolised as a god who can protect children from any harm.

The story shifts to the narrator, Jai, who begins his story with a missing kid in his neighbourhood. Bahadur, Jai's classmate, has been missing for five days. He's a stutterer and has an alcoholic father. Jai is interested in looking for Bahadur and suggested the idea to his two friends, Pari and Faiz. He feels he's the only one who can solve the mystery after watching hundreds of TV shows despite Pari being the smartest among them and Faiz working for a living.

While the story focuses on Jai's narration about Bahadur's disappearance, which causes a chaotic scene in the village, a minor glimpse of Bahadur's whereabouts ends bizarrely. Jai and Pari go around the neighbourhood, asking a few questions for any clues about Bahadur. Then, Bahadur's close friend Omvir is missing after a few days. Omvir's story also indicates he's probably kidnapped with a strange ending like Bahadur. 

The next missing person is a sixteen-year-old girl who has been scandalised with twisted stories. Later, the story is followed up with a brief background about her whereabouts on the day of her disappearance. The number of missing children continues, and each disappearance comes with the child's account on the day of their mishap.

## Personal Notes
- Brilliantly captured the diversity of social status and the constant mixing of religion with politics by the politicians and authorities to gain power in oppressing the minority.
- Beautifully written of the innocence and naivety of a kid who thinks he knows a lot and wants to be a hero inspired by a TV show.
- The exposure of police corruption and brutality, which I assumed is a common thing in India.
- The strong influence of Hinduism and the hatred against Pakistan and Muslims, which is also one of the minority groups in India.
- There are always gossip and twisted stories spreading around the basti. The writer applies those to create a lively community despite its shoddy environment.
- Faiz is a religious Muslim and believes in djinn. Pari is a studious and intellectual girl. Jai just wants to have fun or become a hero detective like on the TV show.
- I have a contradictory feeling when reading this book. One part of me enjoyed the details of the environment, such as the food, sound, and background settings, despite having to look through the meaning of countless Hindi words. The characters are amusing, and the dialogue can be hilarious sometimes. Another part of me found it hard to lead me to continue reading the story further than my intended pace. The third part of me is I really wanted to know what happened in the end. Will the missing kids return to their homes?
- The reality of the racial divergence between Muslims and Hindus and the massive gap between the rich and the poor. 
- The community patrol and the touching end influenced me to rate the story a 4.
- Sometimes, Jai's character frustrates me, but at the same time, I kept telling myself that he's just a kid. He still doesn't know many things and how the world works. My favourite part:
> Ma picks up the scrunchie.
> 'Put it back,' I tell her. 'It's evidence.'
> 'This is not your stupid show,' Ma screams at me. 'What's wrong with you? I cannot bear to listen to you for a second more.'
- A lot is going on in this story. Their lives are surrounded by various socio-cultural issues such as the caste system, inequality and poverty, gender roles and expectations, religious conflicts, child labour, human trafficking, and corruption.
