# 1909 - 1933
* Manchu Empire ruled China for over 260 years. At that time, Japan attacked China in Manchuria and suffered defeats and loss of territory in 1894 - 95.
* In 1904 - 1905, Japan and Russia fought a major war, and Japan gained victory.
* In 1911, the five-year-old emperor of China, Pu Yi, was overthrown, and a republic was set up with the charismatic figure of Sun Yat-sen briefly at its head. New republican government soon collapsed, and the country split into fiefs. Foreign powers, especially Japan, intensified their attempts to intrude into the area.
* In September 1924, fighting erupted between two main warlord factions in North China.
* On 3 November 1924, the president of China, Tsao Kun, was forced to resign. The Peking garrison was dismissed, and the Peking police office was disbanded. 
* The warlords and their fief system had collapsed. Most of China was controlled by Kuomintang or Nationalists headed by Chiang Kai-shek. The Party wanted to have a new start with stability and moved the capital from Peking to Nanjing. 
* In 1928, the ruler of Manchuria, Chang Tso-lin, the Old Marshal, was assassinated by the Japanese. His son Chang Hsueh-liang joined the Kuomintang and formally integrated Manchuria with the rest of China. 
* In September 1931, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of Manchuria. The Young Marshal, Chang Hsueh-liang, abandoned his capital Mukden (now Shengyang), to the Chinese. He decamped and set his headquarters in Jinzhou with some 200,000 troops.
* Japanese troops occupied Yixian on 6 January 1932. 
* On March 1 1932, the Japanese named the new state Manchukuo ('Manchu Country'), covering most of northeast China. They installed Pu Yi as the head, who was a child who had been China's last emperor. 
* Japanese occupied Jinzhou in January 1932. Jinzhou was a highly strategic location and played a central role in the takeover of Manchuria. It was the main focus of a major diplomatic dispute between the United States and Japan and a pivotal episode in a series of events that led to Pearl Harbour ten years later.

- Without power or money, no Chinese could feel safe from the depredations of officialdom or random violence. There had never been a proper legal system. Justice was arbitrary, and cruelty was institutionalised and capricious. An official with power was the law.
  
- Bound feet are called in Chinese 'three-inch golden lilies' (san-tsun-gin-lian). Women with bound feet walked 'like a tender young willow shoots in a spring breeze'. Bound feet were supposed to have an erotic effect on men, partly because her vulnerability induced a feeling of protectiveness in the onlooker.

# 1937 - 1945 (Japanese Invasion)
* In July 1937, Jinzhou became the assembly point for the Japanese in their assault on China proper. 
*  On June 1 1939, the government announced that rice was reserved for the Japanese and a few collaborators. Most of the local population had to subsist on a diet of acorn meal and sorghum, which were difficult to digest.
* In 1942, Mao started a 'Rectification' campaign and invited criticisms about how things were being run in Yan'an. Mao didn't like the criticism and turned his campaign into a witch-hunt.
* In 1942, the Japanese found themselves running short of labour. Their army stretched across China, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. The children had to work in a textile factory.
* In 1943, one of Japan's allies, Italy, surrendered.
* In 1944, some Japanese civilians staffing government offices in Manchukuo were being conscripted.
* On July 29 1944, American B-29s appeared in the sky over Jinzhou for the first time.
* In December 1944, American B-29s appeared for the second time.
* In May 1945, news spread around Jinzhou that Germany had surrendered and the war in Europe was over.
* On August 9 1945, Soviet and Mongolian troops entered Manchukuo. News came through that Americans had dropped two atomic bombs on Japan.
* On August 15 1945, the Japanese emperor surrendered. In Jinzhou, the looting, raping, and killing continued until eight days after the Japanese surrender.
* On August 16 1945, Pu Yi abdicated as emperor of Manchukuo.

<summary>Additional Notes </summary>

- The people were at the edge of starvation due to locally produced rice being exported to Japan, and most rice and wheat were taken by the Japanese army in Manchuria. Locals could only get some maise and sorghum, which are scarce. Acorn meals became the main food for the locals.
- Garrotted prisoners were put into thin wooden boxes and taken on a cart to a barren land called South Hill, infested with wild dogs living on the corpses. Baby girls killed by their families were often dumped in the pit.
- Japanese uses local thugs for neighbourhood control. The neighbourhood bosses helped collect taxes, and the Japanese offered large rewards for turning people in. Manchukuo police were less threatening, and many of them anti-Japanese. Their main jobs were to check people's registration and frequent house-to-house searches.
- The local girls had to walk four miles each way while the Japanese children went by truck to work. Local girls had thin gruel with mouldy maise, while Japanese girls had packed lunch with meat, vegetables, and fruit.
- Japanese girls had easy jobs, while local girls had to operate complex machines, which were even dangerous for adults.
- The Japanese tightly controlled education, especially the history and ethics courses. Japanese was the official language in the schools. 
- Educate children by forcing them to watch newsreels of Japan's progress in the war. It created fear and was not ashamed of their brutality by showing violence and gruesome scenes.
- The teaching in the elementary school for students above the Fourth Form was entirely Japanese, and most teachers were Japanese. The pupils were educated to be obedient subjects of Manchukuo. 
- Japanese children attended separate schools, which were well-equipped and well-heated, with shining floors and clean windows. The schools for the local children were in dilapidated temples, crumbling houses donated by private patrons, and no heating.
- Japanese teaching methods like hitting the children with a wooden club or slapping them on the face when rules and etiquette were not appropriately observed. Another punishment was to be made to kneel for hours in the snow.
- Boys and girls received different educations in high school. Girls must be turned into gracious wives and good mothers - looking after the household, cooking and sewing, the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, embroidery, drawing and the appreciation of art. It also included how to dress, do one's hair, bow, and obey without question which to please one's husband.
- Examination board made up of local officials, both Japanese and Chinese. Japanese officials often picked fiancees from among the girls as intermarriage was encouraged. Some were selected to go to Japan to be married to men they had not met. 
- Local children had to bow to a Japanese if they passed a Japanese in the street and mostly got hit by Japanese without reason, same as adults as they fear offending the Japanese.
- Labourers worked to death in mines under Japanese guards to produce exports to Japan. Many were deprived of salt and didn't have the energy to run away.
- After the Japanese emperor surrendered, most Japanese all over Jinzhou were committing suicide or were lynched, and their houses were looted. Japanese teachers were beaten by schoolchildren, and some Japanese women were raped.

# 1945 - 1949
* On August 24 1945, the Soviet Red Army arrived in Jinzhou.
* The Russians formally recognised Kuomintang as the government of China.
* On November 11, 1945 the Soviet Red Army left the Jinzhou area and pulled back to northern Manchuria.
* In 1947, Communist armies outnumbered those of their opponents, and 300,000 Kuomintang troops were out of action.
* Mid-December 1947, a crowd of 20,000 people raided two well-stocked grain stores.
* From 1947 - 48, the economy was getting worse. Protests against food shortages and prices increasing. 
* In the summer of 1948, about 200,000 Kuomintang troops were in Jinzhou under several commands. Chiang Kai-shek had been clashing with many of his top generals, demoralising the Party. Different forces were poorly coordinated and often distrusted each other.
* In the spring of 1948, Kuomintang began to construct a new defence system around Jinzhou, made of cement blocks encased in steel frames, but the project was half-completed due to the lack of materials, poor planning and corruption. By September, the Communist forces began to cut the city off.
* By the end of 1947, inflation had risen to just over 100,000 per cent and went to 2,870,000 per cent by the end of 1948 in the Kuomintang areas.
* By September 1948, Kuomintang had only three strongholds in Manchuria - Mukden, Changchun and Jinzhou, and the 300 miles of railway track linking them.
* 12 September 1948, the assault on Jinzhou began. 
* By October 1 1948, the encirclement of Jinzhou was completed.
* On October 8 1948, the Communists moved almost a quarter of a million troops into attack positions.
* On October 13 1948, the Kuomintang defence collapsed.
* On October 14 1948, the final offensive started. The battle of Jinzhou lasted 31 hours. 20,000 Kuomintang soldiers were killed, and over 80,000 were captured. 
* Most shops reopened on October 20 1948; two days later, schools reopened, and offices resumed.
* On October 23 1948, sizeable Kuomintang forces unsuccessfully tried to retake Jinzhou. The loss of Jinzhou led to the collapse of Mukden and Changchun. 
* On November 2 1948, the whole of Manchuria was in Communist hands.
* On December 3 1948, banks in Jinzhou reopened, and the electricity supply resumed the next day.
* On December 29 1948, a new administration system was announced with residents' committees in place of the old neighbourhood committees. 
* On December 30 1948, running water in Jinzhou resumed.
* On December 31 1948, the railway in Jinzhou reopened.
* In the summer of 1949, the Communists captured Chiang Kai-shek's capital, Nanjing.
* On October 1 1949, Mao's proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic from the top of the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Peking. 
* Chiang Kai-shek fled the Sichuan province for Taiwan in December 1949, and a quarter of a million soldiers were stranded in Sichuan.

  <summary>Additional Notes</summary>

- The Russians were not only distributing goods from the factories but also dismantling them and shipping the equipment back to the Soviet Union. They walk into people's homes and take anything they like. Stories about Russians raping local women spread wild, and Jinzhou was filled with anger and anxiety.
- The Communists restored order and the economy. They talk to the locals and recruit people. After the Japanese surrender, both Communists and Kuomintang tried to occupy as much territory as they could, but Kuomintang had a more extensive and better-equipped army. Communists got into Manchuria, but the Americans helped Chiang Kai-shek set up his establishment there. Over 50,000 US Marines landed in North China, occupying Peking and Tianjin.
- Kuomintang officers and officials came to the school in search of concubines and wives.
- In 1946, women could live on their own and find work. Since 1945, women could contemplate getting into a university.
- Chinese Communists withdrew from Jinzhou, and Kuomintang entered the city. Their plan is to retreat to the countryside and eventually take the cities.
- Kuomintang failed to recover the economy and pocketed most of the factories' revenue. Some officers moved into the houses which the Japanese had vacated.
- Chiang Kai-shek set up a special organisation called the 'Tiger-Beating Squad' to combat widespread corruption. It backfired as it gave the powerful people to extort money from the rich.
- Kuomintang was gradually losing control of the countryside and getting more challenging to get recruits as young men were increasingly unwilling to sacrifice themselves. Civil war became more bloody, and more young men were conscripted.
- Many people had died at the hands of Kuomintang intelligence.
- The Communists held the northern part of Manchuria and much of the countryside; Kuomintang held the main cities except Harbin, seaports and most of the railway lines.
- Many peasants joined the Communist army. The main reason was Communists had carried out a land-to-tiler reform, and the peasants felt they could keep their land if they supported them.
- Peasants were reluctant to enter the city to sell their products due to harassment at the Kuomintang checkpoints, extortion, and products got confiscated.
- When they first arrived, Kuomintang issued a new currency known as the 'Law money' but failed to control inflation. After a time, the Law money was replaced by another currency, the Golden Yuan.
- Trafficking young girls for brothels and slave servants to rich men was prospering. The city was littered with beggars offering their children in exchange for food. 
- There was a shortage of food and clothing as well. Kuomintang placed a ban on selling textiles to the countryside.
- A new university, the Northeast Exile University, in Jinzhou, formed around students and teachers who had fled Communist-occupied northern Manchuria.
- The Exile University was a battleground where the Kuomintang and the Communists competed fiercely for influence. Kuomintang was actively encouraging students and intellectuals to flee farther south. The Communists didn't want to lose these educated people. They modified the land reform programme. Urban capitalists and intellectuals from wealthy families were to be well-treated and protected.
- Communists' policy switch didn't deter the students from fleeing, and they sailed to Tianjin. There was no food or accommodation for them. On 5 July, they went for a demonstration for food and accommodation. Troops opened fire, and some were injured, and a number were killed.
- Chiang Kai-shek recommended abandoning Mukden and concentrating on holding Jinzhou but could not impose a coherent strategy on his top generals. He was more keen to rely on American intervention, and defeatism permeated his top staff.
- After the siege ended in Jinzhou, the streets were littered with corpses and mostly missing body parts. Some were hanging from the telegraph poles. The open sewers were clogged with bloody water, human flesh and rubble.
- Communists ended inflation, setting a favourable exchange rate for converting the worthless Kuomintang money into Communist Great Wall currency.
- The Communists spared Pu Yi and the top generals because they were useful. Mao's stated policy was: 'We kill small Chiang Kai-sheks. We don't kill big Chiang Kai-sheks'.
- The communist policy treats all prisoners well to win ordinary soldiers from poor peasant families. They kept only middle and high-ranking officers. The soldiers were given a choice: either they could go home with the given fare or stay with the Communists to help wipe out the Kuomintang so that nobody would ever take their land away again. 
- Over 1.75 million Kuomintang troops surrendered and crossed to the Communists during the civil war.
- The new government urged the peasants to come and sell food in the city. They issued relief grain, salt, and coal to those in need. The locals were impressed with the new government as they were more disciplined, and there was no looting and rape, demonstrating exemplary behaviour.
- The need to obtain authorisation for an unspecified 'anything' was a fundamental Chinese Communist rule. People learned not to take any action on their own initiative.

# 1950s (The Great Leap Forward)
* Korean War in June 1950 triggered the elimination of all influential people who supported Kuomintang. Mao sent over a million men into Korea to fight with North Koreans against the Americans.
* In late 1951, launched a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy called the 'Three Antis Campaign' aimed at people in the Party. 
* In the spring of 1952, 'Five Antis' was aimed at capitalists. Bribery, tax evasion, fraud, theft of state property, and obtaining economic information through corruption.
* In 1953, a civil service ranking system was instituted. All officials and government employees were divided into twenty-six grades.
* By the middle of 1953, the 'Three Antis' and 'Five Antis' campaigns had wound down. The capitalists had been brought to heel, and the Kuomintang had been eradicated.
* In July 1955, Mao called for speeding up collective farming.
* In November 1955, Mao abruptly announced that all industry and commerce, which had so far remained in private hands, were to be nationalised.
* In 1956, China was more stable than ever in the century. Officials started to have Sundays off.
* Late 1956, the system of state allowances was abolished.
* In the spring of 1956, Mao announced a policy known as the 'Hundred Flowers' - greater freedom for the arts, literature and scientific research and enlisting the support of China's educated citizens.
* In the spring of 1957, the Party urged intellectuals to criticise officials all the way to the top. The outburst of criticism lasted for a month. In June, Mao categorised those intellectuals or critics as rightists, and they must be smashed. The Anti-Rightist campaign ended after one year, which led to the lesson to anyone that any criticism wasn't going to be tolerated.
* In 1958, Chairman Mao ordered the nation to make a lot of steel and ordered steel output to be doubled in one year - from 5.35 million tons in 1957 to 10.7 million in 1958.
* In 1958, Mao outlined his 'Great Leap Forward' in Chengdu. Mao ordered peasant cooperatives to merge into bigger institutions called 'people's communes'. China was organised into these units, each containing between 2000 and 20,000 households.
* In 1958, Mao defined communism as 'public canteens with free meals'. The regime effectively banned eating at home. Every peasant had to eat in the commune canteen. Agriculture was also neglected because of the priority given to steel.
* End of 1958, the beginning of construction for ten great buildings in Peking to be completed in ten months to mark the tenth anniversary October 1 1959, of the founding of the People's Republic.
* At the end of June 1959, a dispute within the Party when the defence minister, Marshal Peng Dehuai, criticised Mao's Great Leap Forward.

  <summary>Additional Notes</summary>
  
- The campaign 'hidden counter-revolutionaries' had been triggered by Mao's reaction to the behaviour of some Communist writers, notably the famous author Hu Feng. Mao feared that independent thinking might lead to less than total obedience to him. Several leading writers were arrested and labelled as 'counter-revolutionary conspiracy'. This indicates the beginning of the end of individual expression in China. The Party had taken over all the media when the Communists came to power.
- All officials were living on a comprehensive allowance system called gong-ji-zhi. They received no salary, but the state provided them housing, food, clothing, daily necessities, and a small amount of pocket money - as in an army. Everyone had to eat in canteens where the food was meagre and unappetising. You were not allowed to cook at home, even if you had cash from another source.
- The Party's intrusion into people's lives was the process known as 'thought reform'. Mao wanted external discipline and total subjection of all thoughts. Weekly meeting for 'thought examination' was held, and everyone had to criticise themselves for incorrect views and be subjected to the criticism of others. The idea was that people should be reformed to be more like peasants. 
- Agrarian reform law called 'the land returning home' was to redistribute all farmland so that every farmer owned more or less equal land. Landowners were to be allowed to keep a plot.
- During the Korean War, the government encouraged people to donate valuables to buy fighter planes.
- To be labelled as rightist not only to become a political outcast and lose one's job. The children and family would suffer discrimination, and their future would be in jeopardy. The children would be ostracised at school and in the street where they lived. The residents' committee would spy on the family to see who was visiting them. The peasants would give the rightist and his family the most challenging job if sent to the countryside.
- Anti-Rightist Campaign not only reduced people to silence, the quota system combined with personal vendetta meant that anyone could be persecuted for nothing.

# 1959 - 1962 (The Great Chinese Famine)
* In 1960, the great famine spread across China. Monthly food ration began.
* In 1961, tens of millions of deaths finally forced Mao to give up his economic policies. Mao reluctantly allowed President Liu and Deng Xiaoping, the general secretary of the Party, more control over the country. No mass production of steel, public canteens were abolished, peasants' income was related to their work, peasants were given back household property after being confiscated by the communes and had small plots of land to till privately. People who had been purged in various political campaigns were rehabilitated.

<details>
<summary>Additonal Notes</summary>

- Teachers were too preoccupied with the vats, and all scrap iron, including old woks, was fed into them. Hospital grounds have a furnace, and the staff had to constantly feed logs into it. The entire population was thrown into this, including nearly 100 million peasants pulled out of agricultural work.
- Chairman Mao disliked sparrows because they devour grains. Every household sat outside, beating metal objects to scare the sparrows until they were exhausted and dead.
- Peasants moved crops from several plots to one plot of land. Untimely transplantation and harmful density caused crops generally die within a few days. It was used to show the Party about miracle harvest and deceived visitors such as scientists and reporters. Peasants were boasting and competing with their output. People had learned to defy reason and to live with acting.
- Peasants ate to their hearts' content at the commune canteen and even wasted the entire food reserve in the countryside. They didn't care how much they worked because the produce belonged to the state. They would get a share regardless of how much they work. They went to the fields and had a good snooze.
- Great Leap Forward triggered the most severe split in the leadership since the Communists were in power. Mao remained chairman of the Party but stepped down from less important posts in favour of Liu Shaoqi, the number two man in China.
- Mao's authority was unchallengeable. Officers couldn't speak their minds and resigned as resignation indicated an unacceptable protest. There was no opting out.
- Starvation was much worse in the countryside because there were no guaranteed rations. Government policy was to provide food for the cities first. The peasants who had grown the food died in the millions all over China.

<br>

# 1963
* Split between China and the Soviet Union.
* In April 1963, Mao banned all 'Ghost Dramas', a genre rich in ancient tales of revenge by dead victims' spirits on those who had persecuted them. To him, these ghost avengers were uncomfortably close to the 'class enemies' who had perished under his rule. 
<br>

# 1964 - 1965 (The Cult of Mao)
* In 1964, the cult of Mao began due to the death of a soldier Lei Feng who did a lot of good deeds and his devotion to Chairman Mao. The cult of Mao is Mao's plans for a showdown with the president, Liu and Deng, the general secretary.
* Since 1964, large houses have been opened as a 'museum of class education' to show how 'class enemies' like landlords had lived in luxury on the sweat and blood of the peasants before Mao came.
* In October 1964, China exploded its first atomic bomb.
* In 1964, France recognised China at the full ambassadorial level, the first Western nation to do so.
* In 1964, Mao made a list of 39 artists, writers, and scholars for denunciation, branded them 'reactionary bourgeois authorities' and circulated to officials.
* In 1965, Mao instructed that grass, flowers and pets were 'bourgeois habits' and were to be eliminated. The students need to remove all the grass from the lawns in school.
* On November 10 1965, Cultural Revolution appeared in an article in Shanghai where no other newspapers printed it.
<br>

# 1966 - 1976 (Cultural Revolution)
* Mao set up a new body called the Cultural Revolution Authority in May 1966 and appointed his former secretary Chen Boda to take over 'People's Daily' (the official Party newspaper) on May 31 so he could talk to the people.
* The Quotations of Chairman Mao were collected together in a pocket-sized book with a red plastic cover, known as 'The Little Red Book'. Everyone was given a copy.
* At the beginning of June 1966, a few activists from a middle school decided to call themselves 'the Red Guards of Chairman Mao' with the motto 'Rebellion is justified'. They were Mao's shock troops. Mao wanted to create chaos and used the young Red Guards, mostly high officials' children.
* Starting from June 1966, there was no schooling. The teachers either had been denounced or were organising their own Rebel groups.
* On August 18 1966, a mammoth rally was held in Tiananmen Square with over a million young participants.
* In 1967, Mao wanted to replace the 'bourgeois headquarters' and the existing Party hierarchy with his personal power system. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were formally denounced and detained, as was Tao Zhu.
* In January 9 1967, Rebels took control. Mao called on people throughout China to emulate them and seize power from the capitalist roaders.
* In late February 1967, an aeroplane flew over Chengdu and spread thousands copy of a letter dated February 17 and signed by the Central Military Committee that told the Rebels to desist from their violent actions.
* Mao called on the army to support the Rebels. The marshals condemned the Cultural Revolution for persecuting innocent people and destabilising the country. They began to take steps to try to stop the violence after a series of political meetings. Retributions against the opposition were swift. Mao gave the word to punish the marshals, but the army didn't support them.
* In the summer of 1967, factional fighting among the Rebels escalated into a mini-civil war all over China.
* The fourth stage of the Cultural Revolution started in 1968. Phase 1: teenage Red Guards. Phase 2: The Rebels and the attacks on capitalist roaders; Phase 3: factional wars among the Rebels. The largest witch-hunts of the new political campaign were 'Clean Up the Class Ranks'.
* On June 2 1968, the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee was established.
* In the autumn of 1968, 'Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams' took over schools. The soldiers or workers recalled all the pupils who had been in the school so they could be kept under control.
* By the end of 1968, all university students in China had summarily 'graduated' en masse, without any exam, assigned jobs and dispersed to every corner of the land.
* In 1969, millions of urban dwellers were exiled to the countryside. Young people would not be roaming in the cities with nothing to do, creating trouble out of boredom. The old administration had been replaced by Mao's Revolutionary Committees. According to Mao's rhetoric, they were sent to the countryside 'to be reformed' and advocated 'thought reform through labour' for everyone.
* In January 1969, every middle school in Chengdu was sent to a rural area somewhere in Sichuan. They were to live in villages among the peasants to be reeducated by them.
* In April 1969, the Ninth Congress marked the formal establishment of Mao's personal power system.
* On October 17 1969, Lin Biao ordered the country into a state of war. He sent his opponents in the army and the disgraced top leaders out of the capital and placed them under house arrest or detention in different parts of China.
* In 1971, Lin Biao was killed. He tried to assassinate Mao but failed. He tried to flee to the Soviet Union, and his plane crashed in Mongolia. Some capitalist roaders started to be rehabilitated and released from the camps. Mao sanctioned the mass rehabilitation because the death of Lin Biao and the purge of his men caused him had lost the hand with which he had controlled the army.
* In 1972, Zhou Enlai had increased power and got the economy going.
* In February 1972, President Nixon visited China. The increased availability of information from abroad as part of general liberalisation after the downfall of Lin Biao and Nixon's visit gave a convenient pretext.
* In the spring of 1973, Deng Xiaoping was rehabilitated and appointed Vice-Premier, the de-facto deputy to the ailing Zhou Enlai.
* In the summer of 1973, university enrolment started.
* In January 1974, Mme Mao and her cohorts called for schoolchildren to rebel against their teachers again. They wanted to create trouble for Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping so they had a chance to shine.
* In July 1974, Mao warned against forming a 'Gang of Four' consisting of three men from Shanghai - Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen. They banded together to hold the fort of the Cultural Revolution with Mme Mao.
* On January 8 1976, Premier Zhou En Lai died. Mao appointed an ineffectual nobody called Hua Guofeng to succeed Zhou and launched a campaign to denounce Deng and hit back against a right-wing comeback.
* In the spring of 1976, acts of protest broke out all over China. In Peking, hundreds of thousands of citizens gathered for days in Tiananmen Square to mourn Zhou. They even poured out their hatred of the Gang of Four and Mao in coded language.
* On April 5 1976, the protest was crushed when the police attacked the crowds, arresting hundreds. Mao and the 'Gang of Four' called this a 'Hungarian-type counter-revolutionary rebellion'. Deng Xiaoping was being held incommunicado, accused of stage-managing the demonstrations. Mao officially fired Deng and intensified the campaign against him.
* On July 28 1976, an earthquake at a coal-mining city, Tangshan. The official figure was 242,000 dead and 164,000 badly injured.

<summary>Additional Notes</summary>

- Teachers were abused, tortured and beaten in every school by schoolchildren during the Cultural Revolution. Many writers and artists committed suicide, and many of their works were burned.
- Red Guards changed some of the street names to be more revolutionary. Red means 'stop', was considered counter-revolutionary, and it should, of course, 'go'. And traffic shouldn't keep to the right; it should be on the left.
- No one dared to burn or throw away any newspapers. Every front page carried Mao's portrait, and every few lines featured Mao's quotations. These papers had to be treasured, and disposing of them was a disaster. But keeping old newspapers will attract mice or even get rotten, which was also a crime against Mao.
- The population increased during the Cultural Revolution by two hundred million.
- Mme Mao had insisted on women doing the same kind of work as men. But women knew that when they were given the privilege of this equality, they were in for hard physical labour.
- The cadres' schools were not concentration camps or gulags. There were isolated places of detention where the inmates had restricted freedom and had to do hard labour under strict supervision. Writers, scholars, scientists, teachers, doctors, and actors who had become useless in Mao's order were dispatched there, even surplus Rebel.
- All the peasants had to work. Each earned a fixed number of 'work points' (gong-fen) for their day's work. The number of work points accumulated was an essential element in the distribution at the end of the year. After the harvest, the production team paid part of it over as tax to the state. Then the rest was divided up. First, the basic quantity was equal for every male and about a quarter less for every female. Children under three received a half portion.
- The remainder of the crop was then distributed according to how many points each person had earned. Twice a year, the peasants would all assemble to fix the daily work points for each person. Most young and middle-aged men would be allocated ten points a day, and women eight. Some exceptionally strong ones got an extra point. Class enemies like the former village landlord and his family got a couple of points less than the others. The number of work points accumulated depended mainly on how many days one worked rather than how one worked. Ten days counted as a full day. 
- Under Mao, the Chinese placed great importance on dignity in front of foreigners, which was meant to appear aloof or inscrutable.
- After the Tangshan earthquake was announced, the Gang of Four warned that the nation mustn't be diverted by the earthquake and forget the priority - to denounce Deng. Mme Mao said denouncing Deng concerns hundred million people was more important than merely several hundred thousand deaths.

# 1976 - 1978 (After the Death of Mao)
* On September 9 1976, Chairman Mao died.
* On October 6, 1976, Mme Mao and the 'Gang of Four' were arrested. No support from the army, police, and even their own guards.

- Deng had declared that university entrance must be through academic exams, not the back door. Scholarships for studying in the West were to be awarded based on a national academic examination held simultaneously in Peking, Shanghai and Xi'an.
- Social outcasts, including the 'class enemies ', were rehabilitated. Official discrimination against them and their families stopped. They could leave their hard physical labour and were given better jobs. Verdicts clearing victims were drawn up, and old incriminating records were burned.
