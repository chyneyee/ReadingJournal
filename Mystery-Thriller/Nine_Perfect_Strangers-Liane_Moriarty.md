# Nine Perfect Strangers - Liane Moriarty

## Summary
Yao on his first day as a trainee paramedic. On his third call-out, he faced a patient who had a seizure and was later in full cardiac arrest in her office after he and Finn had shocked her twice. Ten years later, he became a wellness consultant at Tranquillum House and the patient, Masha, is Tranquillum House's director.

<b>Ten Years Later</b>
- Frances Welty is a fifty-two-year-old former bestselling romantic novelist. She is twice divorced, and recently, she has been experiencing menopause, back pain and a romance scam. Her friend Ellen suggested Tranquillum House, a 'boutique health and wellness resort'. 
- Lars Lee is on his way to Tranquillum House but decides to stop by at a winery before he has to experience the ten-day cleansing session without alcohol. Lars, a family lawyer, is having a problem with his boyfriend Ray about deciding to have a baby. Lars stands firm that he won't want one, but Ray hopes Lars is considering changing his mind. This leads to speculating whether Ray wants to be a father or permission to leave him.
- Ben has to give in to his wife Jessica for detoxing their minds and bodies to save their marriage. Both have different opinions about their marriage issues. Jessica feels Ben cares more about his Lamborghini than caring for her. She feels Ben no longer loves her, although she feels she's in her best state with all the plastic surgeries she invested in. Ben didn't share the same perspective as Jessica regarding beauty; deep down, he preferred the previous Jessica without any cosmetic jobs. Two years ago, their place was robbed, and Ben's mother sent them a card with a lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket that changed their lives and possibly led to their relationship falling apart. Jessica enjoys her luxurious lifestyle, but at the same time, she feels Ben might not feel the same as her, especially since he has a drug-addicted sister. The winning money also caused many estrangements between families and unnecessary disturbances.
- Carmel Schneider, 39, a divorcee with young children. Her ex-husband left her because he no longer felt that she was attractive. Recently, he has been dating a beautiful girlfriend and bringing their four kids to Europe. She wishes she could be transformed into a fitter and healthier woman so her ex-husband would regret the decision, but she doesn't want him back.
- Tony Hogburn, 56, is a divorcee who wants to lose weight after ten days of cleansing sessions. Recently, his dog died, and he still couldn't move on after six months. He runs a sports marketing consultancy and is a legendary football (Australian Football League) player.. He has a distant relationship with his children and grandchildren. 
- The Marconi family consists of Napoleon and Heather, both forty-eight and their daughter, Zoe, twenty. Napoleon was a schoolteacher in a disadvantaged area, making him a disciplined person and a rule stickler. This contrasts with Heather, who is pragmatic and feels the rules of having no contact with family in the wellness resort are unacceptable. 
- Meanwhile, recently, Zoe has had a few minor panic attacks, and this leads to the revelation of why her parents turned into worrisome parents after her brother's death. She chooses to stay close to her parents because she wants to reduce their grief. During her conversation with Frances, she also reveals that her dead brother, Zach, was her twin. Her parents are exercise fanatics. Her dad is a junk food addict, whereas her mother has an eating disorder. She has a sugar addiction.
- In ten days, there would be no alcohol, sugar, caffeine, gluten, or dairy. Meals would be personalised according to her needs. Before the booking, the guest has to tick the boxes for what they hoped to achieve during the ten days and also answer several personal online questionnaires, including relationship status, diet, medical history, alcohol consumption in the previous week, and so on. The guest even had to upload a photo taken in the last two weeks.

<b>Cleansing methods</b>
- Noble silence - no human interactions or talking to anyone after three ringings of the bell.
- Meditating in the most relaxed position, in any position the guest feels most comfortable.
- Three healthy smoothies will be sent to the room in the morning, afternoon, and before bedtime. Customised meals will be prepared according to the guest's needs.
- Starlight meditation on the first night. The wellness consultant appears in the guest's room without their knowledge and requires the guest to participate for half an hour.
- Taichi
- Slow-walk hiking
- Light fasting
- Psychedelic therapy
- Death row game when a guest needs to defend another guest's worthiness to live.

## Personal Notes
- Why are most of the guests in this story divorced or have relationship issues? 
- I believe such people exist in real life. They shouldn't join the cleansing session if they are not committed to following the rules. If their free life of eating whatever they want is working, why do they need to cleanse themselves? You can't choose to eat whatever crap, but at the same time, the body stays healthy and fit. I wonder whether most people think a wellness resort is a vacation for them. I really don't get it. If someone wants to enjoy their lives with freedom, they should travel somewhere and enjoy the luxury, not a wellness resort. I think the word "cleansing" is already meant to detox your body. What's the point of doing it if you continue with old habits or a poor diet?
- Amusing characters, although most of them are annoying. At the same time, it's sad to read that most of them have personal struggles.
- The story was initially interesting, but when it reached the counselling part, I realised there were so many gender-based criticisms or comments. One example is the hatred tone against men for easily losing weight than women, which is also mentioned more than once. Then, the confusion between Masha's confidence and superior tone toward the guests, especially the bitter tone towards men.
- Psychedelic therapy is the turning point where everyone needs to face their past, which triggered their sadness, failure and regrets.
A cleansing session in a wellness resort, which goes well in the beginning, turns darker and more sinister when the owner's past mistake causes her to go haywire.
