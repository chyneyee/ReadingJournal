# The Talisman (The Talisman #1) - Stephen King & Peter Straub

## Storyline
Speedy tells Jack he must go to Alhambra, where the Talisman is. The Talisman is not too big or small, and she looks like a crystal ball. The Talisman is to save his mother and Laura DeLoessian, the Queen of the Territories.

On September 15, 1981, Jack Sawyer, a twelve-year-old boy, is reflecting his pain for the last three months. He and his mother moved from an apartment on Central Park West, Los Angeles, to a quiet tiny resort at Arcadia Beach, New Hampshire. They are running away from someone, probably Morgan Sloat, Jack's late father's business partner, and his mother is dying soon. Jack meets a new friend called Speedy in Funworld. At that stage, Jack is feeling depressed with the passing of Uncle Tommy and is worrying that his mother will be dying as well.

In the Territories, Laura DeLoessian, the Queen of Territories, is a twinner or a parallel individual of Jack's mother. The twinner of Uncle Morgan is hoping that Queen Laura dies. If someone dies, the twinner will die eventually as well. Under Speedy's encouragement, Jack travels to the Territories to find the crystal "the Talisman" to save his mother, who is dying from cancer.

The Territories is a parallel medieval universe. Individuals in the Territories have "twinners" or parallel individuals in our world. Twinners' births, deaths, and (it is intimated) other major life events are usually paralleled. Twinners can also "flip" or migrate to the other world but only share the body of their alternate universe's analogue.

In the Territories, when Jack is hiding in the woods from Morgan of Oris (the twinner of Morgan Sloat), he is almost choked to death by the trees, forcing him to flip back into this world. Jack continues his journey through the country and gets a job as a bartender in Oakley, New York. He tries to escape from his abusive boss and later being chased by his stalker when he's fleeing from Oatley. He returns to the Territories and runs into Elroy and Morgan again. 

He flips back to this world and ends up in Ohio. On the road, Jack runs into Morgan at the rest stop. Then, he flips into the Territories and meets a werewolf named Wolf. Wolf knew Phil and Morgan. He even knows Phil is Jack's father based on the smells. Jack and Wolf become friends. When Morgan discovers Jack's whereabouts, Jack returns to this world with Wolf. Wolf is struggling with the noises and smells in this world. Besides that, Jack has to find a way to lock Wolf or isolate him far away from any human beings when the full moon comes.

- Jack finds Morgan Sloat's son Richard at a boarding school in Illinois. Richard's schoolmates turn into werewolves. Jack brings Richard along to escape and flip into the Territories.
- In the Territories, Anders is sending a shipment of weapons to Morgan's soldiers. Richard still believes that he is sick and hallucinating, denying the existence of the Territories.

## Personal Thoughts
- I hesitated to start this book because I worried it would resemble 'The Dark Tower'. I was very lost in that book. The intriguing storytelling guided me to continue reading the book, although I wasn't so sure how much I understood the story. I am as lost as Jack, wondering what is the Territories and all those names mentioned by Speedy.
- It can be frustrating to read because it is a lengthy story. It's a mixture of frustration and excitement because it's rare to find such a storytelling style nowadays. 
- Jack has a lot of patience with his travelling companions, Wolf and Richard. His maturity is beyond his age. He can accept whatever comes to him and tolerate the different shapes and forms of his friends. Sometimes he loses his patience with Wolf but is willing to take responsibility since he was the one who took Wolf into this world.
- Jack allows Richard to continue denying the existence of the Territories and tries to protect Richard from knowing the truth about his father's wicked acts.
- The friendship between Jack and Wolf and Jack with Richard is beautifully written. 
- It's ironic when Wolf struggles to adapt to this world, whereas Richard is hard to accept the Territories.
- I started losing patience when reading the Blasted Lands to the Black Castle. I wish Jack had reached the Talisman sooner. Even though the journey to the Blasted Lands is rich with fantasy,  I'm more interested in whether Jack gets the Talisman and what happens after he obtains the Talisman.
