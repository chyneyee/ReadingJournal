# Joe Cinque's Consolation: A True Story of Death, Grief and the Law - Helen Garner

## Summary
- Joe Cinque died on 26 October 1997. The ambulance took almost twenty minutes after having difficulty getting the correct address from a hysterical woman who made the emergency call. Vomit was coming out of his mouth. He wasn't breathing, but his skin was still warm. The paramedics worked over his body for more than five minutes and he was still not breathing. They saw that he was gone. The young woman couldn't accept that the man was gone and very emotional. There was no suicide note but she told them that the suicide had been planned for two months. The dead man had taken the drugs around three in the morning.
- She told the police that she gave Joe Rohypnol and heroin and they were planning to die together. The woman's name was Anu Singh. She was brought to the police station and charged with murder. After two days, the police also charged her close friend Madhavi Rao with murder.
- The two young women were law students at the Australian National University. They were tried in Canberra for the murder of Singh's boyfriend. There was a special dinner party that had been held at the couple's house before he was killed. Rohypnol was in Joe's coffee and later she injected heroin into his arm.
- The writer follows the court trial and shares her research, and observations about the accused as well as her opinions about the case.

## Personal Thoughts
- I am only interested in the case more than her opinions about the accused and the case. The book was not what I expected. I was surprised when the writer included her personal life, views and judgement about the case. I thought the entire book would offer deeper insights into the case. I never expected the book would be the writer's journey or interview process about Joe's and Anu's family.
- The writing style is not my cup of tea. I'd prefer this book to be written without the writer's personal view and judgment. I wish the writer remained impartial or maybe left her opinions at the end of the book. Most of the time, the writer is emotional and overly sided with the victim's family. She vented her frustrations and disagreements with the defendants' lawyers for the accused. I feel I don't need to know how she feels. 
- I found it hard to read this book peacefully and understand the arguments for both sides because I was distracted by the noises of the writer. I wish she just left me alone to analyse the case myself instead of guiding me with her emotions and her criticism against the lawyers. Sometimes, she's trying too hard to convince the reader to understand her and to share her hate towards the accused.
- I don't understand why the writer still wants to write to Anu and Madhavi after the case is closed. Although her rage and views about them are not equivalent to Maria, Joe's mother, they are on their way to reaching Maria's level. So, whatever answers the accused has for her questions, I feel she won't be able to accept them. I wonder if it's really for the book or to take the chance to inflict their wounds on behalf of Joe's family?
- I'd rather the book ends after the case or Anu's release instead of dragging the book with stories about Joe from his friends. I don't understand why we need such an ending about Joe's friends telling us how good he was and how evil Anu was. It feels like the writer needs to convince the readers how wrong the judgement was and we must believe that Joe was a good person.
