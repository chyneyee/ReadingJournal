# The Beresford - Will Carver

## Summary
The Beresford is a grand, spacious but affordable apartment building located outside the city. Abe Schwartz just killed his neighbour. In sixty seconds, Blair Conroy will ring the doorbell to her new home, and Abe will answer the door. When the time comes for one of them to die, there will be sixty seconds to move the body before the next unknown arrives at the door. 

Abe's appearance doesn't look like a dangerous or charismatic man. He is average and looks normal. He lives in a one-bedroom furnished flat in an apartment building called The Beresford. It is the first time he killed someone. He doesn't even know how to bury the body and depends on the searches that he found on the Internet. While Abe is finding the best method to remove the body, Blair rings the doorbell.

## Personal Thoughts
- The story is intriguing, but the storytelling is repetitive. It has been repeatedly mentioned that Blair wants to be an independent woman and leave her small town, and Abe is a nice guy with dark secrets.
- Besides each part focuses on Abe and his encounter with a new victim, which leads to the "accidental killing", every part includes a minor story of the victim's thoughts before they were killed.
- The entire story is about a current occupant of the building who kills the latest tenant and another new tenant will move in to replace the murdered one. The cycle continues, and the thrilling part is the owner knows why some of the tenants disappear without any reason.
- It's a very unique story which made me continue reading it because I really wanted to know what happened in the end. However, the repetitive storytelling can be annoying for some readers. I didn't fully understand the ending part, but overall, it was a compelling story.
