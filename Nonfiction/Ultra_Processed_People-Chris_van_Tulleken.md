# Ultra-Processed People: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn't Food… and Why Can't We Stop? - Chris van Tulleken

## Summary
### Part 1 - Wait, I'm Eating What? (Explaining what is UPF food in detailed, the content and processing methods)
- Aim of UPF is to replace the ingredients of a traditional and much-loved food with cheaper alternatives and additives that extend shelf life, facilitate centralised distribution and, it turns out, drive excess consumption.
- Non-UPF versions are more expensive. The alternative ingredients are generally molecules extracted from crops grown for animal food.
- Chemists have chemically modifying starches where the starches are extracted from various plants. Modified starches can replace fats and dairy.
- Gums used to give food for a longer shelf life.
- According to Carlos Monteiro's paper, food is divided into four groups using a new classification system called the NOVA system:
  - Group 1 — 'unprocessed or minimally processed foods' such as meat, fruit, vegetables, flour, and pasta.
  - Group 2 — 'processed culinary ingredients' such as oils, lard, butter, sugar, salt, vinegar, honey, and starches.
  - Group 3 — 'processed food,' ready-made mixtures of Groups 1 and 2, which are mainly for preservation, such as tins of beans, salted nuts, smoked meat, canned fish, canned fruits, and proper freshly made bread.
  - Group '4 — 'ultra-processed foods.' 
- The resonated definition in summary is 'processes and ingredients used to manufacture ultra-processed foods are designed to create highly profitable (low-cost ingredients, long shelf life, emphatic branding) convenient (ready-to-consume) hyper palatable products liable to display freshly prepared dishes and meals made from all other NOVA food groups'.
- Kevin Hall's paper explains the experiment of putting the volunteers into two different diets - one with UPF and the other without UPF. Participants on UPF diet gained weight whereas on the unprocessed diets they actually lost weight.
- People with higher income spend on a wider variety of foods and eat different types of food than lower income. People with less money have higher rates of obesity which leads to the argument that obesity and diet-related diseases are not a choice.
- UPF isn't harmful simply because it's fatty, salty, and sugary.
- Processing is not factored into our national guidelines. It's possible that someone is eating a high-UPF diet that is low in fat, salt, and sugar which is only healthy according to the guidance but evidence it would probably cause health problems. For example, food from plant-based and reformulated to be low in fat, sugar and salt. We are probably eating healthily according to the packaging and yet consuming huge quantities of UPF.

### Part 2 - But Can't I Just Control What I Eat? (Do we have the power to control what to eat, and is that a person's fault or weak willpower if they're obese, or does UPF have its own problems?)
- The additives are a proxy for UPF. They signal a method and purpose of food production that is linked to disease.
- Individual ingredients of UPF may each be harmful, but in combination, they bring the most harm.
- Hall's theory is not simply that UPF food is delicious and so creates 'hedonic overdrive' where we enjoy eating more than we hate being full. Instead, it's that the new UPF food environment is affecting our ability to self-regulate.
- Cooking our own sweet food at home with sugar is healthier than buying pre-made industrial UPF with sugar added at the source.
- Sugar (including honey) can harm the body, not because it increases your insulin levels, but because it rots your teeth and makes you eat more food.
- High sugar content is one of the properties of UPF that drives weight gain.
-The sugar that really rots teeth is the stuff we consume with acids between meals: fizzy drinks, sweets, and so on. These UPF products damage our teeth because we eat them constantly.
- Inactivity is not a significant contributor. The primary cause is ultra-processed food and drink. This is a threat to the companies whose existence depends on sales of these products.
- The idea that staying active won't allow you to eat more calories; it may be because the opposite idea, that you can burn off excess calories, has been promoted by companies like Coke all the way from the scientific papers through to policy initiatives like Exercise is Medicine.
- Stress produces more of the hormone cortisol, which drives increased intake of calorie-dense UPF through effects on many of those hormones involved in the energy-intake regulation system.
- The difference in people's weight has nothing to do with willpower. It's simply a collision of genes and the constraints of the food environment.

### Part 3 - Oh, so this is why I'm anxious and my belly aches! (What UPF is doing in our body and its effects)
- The UPF food that is too soft, almost pre-chewed in texture, is absorbed so quickly that it doesn't reach the gut that sends the 'stop eating' signal to the brain. 
- Modern faces have smaller jaws due to modern diets. The face and jaw bones grow if you chew.
- Most UPF is dry, which means calorie-dense. The dryness is to stop microbes from growing in it for the purpose of long shelf life, which leads to more profits.
- Higher-energy-density foods and diets promote greater energy intake and increased body weight.
- Eating more quickly increases the risk of eating more, gaining weight, and having metabolic disease. Food that takes longer to process in the mouth makes you feel fuller. 'Fast eating' genes are likely to make some people especially vulnerable to the softness of UPF.
- The number of chews per bite has a direct effect on slowing and reducing food intake.
- UPF manufacturers exploit our body's ability to link calories with a particular smell or flavour barcode. 
- Ultra-processing means that vitamins are destroyed, fibre is reduced, and there's a loss of functional molecules, which results in lots of calories but very little other nutrition.
- We may be eating more food to compensate for becoming increasingly deficient in micronutrients. Ultra-processing reduces micronutrients, leads to malnutrition, and also causes obesity. 
- Flavourings are a proxy for the low micronutrient content.
- Artificial sweeteners are associated with weight gain and diabetes.

### Part 4 - But I already paid for this! (how all the harmful substances get into our food, the impact of over-demand for UPF on the world)
- Most big food processing corporations exploit the legal loopholes and the vulnerable people for profits.
- Sophisticated marketing campaigns target minority groups so that racial identity is inextricably linked to brands. Critiques of these brands lead to critiques of culture, of parenting, and of apparent choice.
- Increasing western fast food, which is mostly UPF, leads to the increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and death. Low-income and middle-income countries have lesser ability to cope with the demand for drugs to manage diabetes or high blood pressure. 
- The production methods used to make UPF create other serious problems such as environmental destruction, carbon emissions, and plastic pollution.

<br>

### Part 5 - What the hell am I supposed to do then?
- Many of the UPF have already been reformulated, which is causing the rise of diet-related diseases.

## Personal Thoughts 
- I like how the writer lays out a series of questions and other existing research at the beginning. From there, he explains his analysis in a simpler manner, and in the end, he throws a different perspective about the discussed topic and makes you question and think deeper about it.
- Usually nonfiction books are boring when it comes to explaining existing research and experiments done by scientists. This is the first time I'm so interested in most of the research and experiments mentioned in this book.
- This book has been on my to-read list for quite some time, but it's always unavailable at the nearby library. I was sceptical about whether I would understand such a serious discussion in this book, but thankfully and surprisingly, I found it easy to understand, and the writer explains most of the things as straightforwardly and clearly as he can.
- The writer also offers advice to the readers to reduce or avoid UPF foods with a non-judgemental approach.
- After reading this book, you will look at your diet choice differently, probably with more caution and scrutiny, especially the content of the food products.
