## Storyline (Potential Spoiler)
Hajime finds a part-time job at the local TV station. The shooting of the shock TV show is at the Segori Village in Hokkaido. He helps to cover up for Miyuki, who is sick, after her friend from the drama club, who works on this show, asks her for help.

The entire crew departs to the vacant main building across the river, leaving Rie and Michio behind. There once was a bridge connecting the two buildings, but the bridge was washed away last summer in a flood. The crew has to travel further, which requires twenty minutes to reach the main building.  The villa uses hydroelectric power, but there is no transmission from midnight until six in the morning. There are five hidden cameras in the annexe. They try to play a prank on Rie and Reika, who are sleeping in the main building. Then, a mysterious figure in the Snow Yaksha or Snow Demon costume appears and kills Rie. The crew witnesses the killing from the monitor screen but couldn't save Rie. It requires a twenty-minute drive, and Marina just left with the van. Hajime asks Marina to check on Rie, but Superintendent Kengo requests Marina to come back in order to preserve the crime scene.

Segori Village was built by poor settlers. During the Meiji era in the late 1600s, it was common that children were sold for slavery. One day, a girl who had been sold ran back to the village with her baby. The villagers didn't welcome her because they fear for her new owner. Her baby died from the cold weather, and she later disappeared into the snowstorm, leaving behind a spell. Since then, whenever there's a heavy storm, there is a myth circulating about her coming back as a snow demon to kill the villagers. 

When Rie was murdered in the annexe building at 5 am sharp, everyone was in the main building except Michio. Hajime suspects the murderer is someone from the villa because only they know where the hidden camera is, and the hidden camera is destroyed after killing Rie. Another villager mentioned that there was a strange light by the Segoori river around the time when the murder occurred.

Later, Michio was found dead, hidden inside a snowman near the villa's main entrance. He had been dead for more than twelve hours and possibly died before Rie. Meanwhile, Superintendent Kengo is challenging Kenmochi to team up with Hajime to compete in solving the case.

Kengo accuses Reika of being the murderer after conducting an experiment of using the ropeway to travel to the annexe building. The ropeway has a weight limit of less than 40 kg, and Reika is probably less than 38 kg. She can travel via the ropeway to the annexe building to kill Rie. Hajime analyses Kengo's loophole and clears Reika's name. The village uses hydroelectric power from the river, but the power supply stops from midnight to six in the morning. The ropeway is not available until 6 am. The crew left the main building at 5.45 am and arrived at the crime scene at 6.05 am. It's impossible for Reika to go to the other side in five minutes. 

Meanwhile, Masashi sees the money bills on the floor, which lead to a room. He sees blood on the bills and the snow demon's axe. Later he is found dead with the money bills with blood. 

Kengo reveals that the current Issei Himuro is an impostor and he is the murderer. When they go to his room to look for him, he is already dead and leaves a suicide note. In the note, he took responsibility for the three murders. He reveals his real name is Takao Mizunuma. He was a makeup artist who worked with Masashi. He told the story of the plane accident and of how he and the other three buried the real Issei Himuro, and he became the impostor for the sake of money. They will tell the public that Issei Himuro was injured and his face is covered with a bandage to keep his disfigured face hidden. The impostor moved to the villa, sold Issei's paintings, and distributed the money among four of them (Masashi, Takao, Rie, and Michio). Takao got greedy and wanted all the money for himself. He started to plan to kill the rest. Then, Takao realised that the portrait shows that Issei is left-handed, but Takao is right-handed. He has forgotten the video recording has shown the original portrait before the painting switch, and Kengo has discovered the truth. Takao took his life by poisoning himself. They even found a snow demon mask and costume in the room. This revelation of the killer also shows that Kenmochi and Hajime lost the bet, and Kenmochi has lost his job.

Hajime finds an important clue in the room. It appears Kengo solved the case first, but he's been tricked by the real murderer.

<summary>The Details</summary>

Hajime finds a pair of left-handed scissors in the office room and concludes that the impostor is left-handed as well. The real Issei died six years earlier in 1983. The scissors case has a label with "tax included", but the consumption tax was enacted in April 1989. It means Takao or the impostor bought the scissors for himself. Hajime has some of Takao's childhood photos faxed from Tokyo, which show he's left-handed. Takao didn't realise that Issei's portrait was painted from reflection and thought Issei was right-handed, leading Takao to pretend to be right-handed. The real killer assumed Takao was right-handed, and he put the pen in Takao's right hand. The killer probably knew the backstory beforehand, and he knew he could make Takao look like the murderer. 

Hajime reveals that Marina Ayatsuji is the real killer and explains how the murders happened. She locked the room from the inside after killing the impostor. She went to the dining room to join the rest to listen to Kengo explain the case. Then, she headed to Issei's office with the rest. She is the only person capable of throwing the key on the carpet since she was the one who entered the room last. She acted like she just found it and called them to see the key. 

Hajime proves that Marina is able to cross to the annexe building in three minutes instead of twenty. At that time of the year, there is a bridge made of ice and only able to be seen after the sunrise. The ice bridge is made by tying the ropes around the guardrails on each side of the ravine. Then, she laid straws and branches on top of the ropes and covered the top with snow. The bridge froze instantly with water from the river. Once the bridge got solid, she cut the ropes securing it on each side. 

Hajime found straws in Michio's hands. Marina came to the ravine on the night before Rie was murdered. It was below zero because of the storm. Michio followed Marina and saw the bridge. Marina got panicked and killed Michio.

On the night of Rie's death, Marina offered coffee to everyone in the van. She put sleeping pills in Takao's coffee to weaken his alibi. Then, around the sunrise, she left the main building five minutes before the shooting of the prank began. The shooting is at 4.55 am. She turned off her radio in the van and crossed the ice bridge. Later she took the rest of the straw and wood and put them on top of the bridge. She poured some gasoline on the ropes and then some more on the debris. She set fire to the bridge to destroy the evidence. The light of the fire was the strange light or "will-o'-the-wisp" seen by the villager around the time of the murder. She parked the van out of sight of the camera and changed into a costume to kill Rie. Then, she returned to the van to wait for the time to look like she just arrived. 

Marina revisits the story of what happened on the day of the plane crash. When her consciousness was recovered after the crash, she found her mother was stuck beneath the wreckage. A few hours later, four people arrived at the scene. She begged for them to help, but they were only busy with other tasks and ignored her. She tried to save her mother but failed to do it by herself. She promised herself that she would take revenge for her mother. In the end, she is willing to be arrested and stated that she has no regrets about killing them.
