# The Institute - Stephen King

## Storyline
Tim Jamieson, a former policeman, is leaving Florida and heading to New York City. After giving up his flight seat and numerous hitchhiking attempts, he finds himself in the small town of DuPray, South Carolina and decides to work as a local patrolman there.

In a different story, Luke Ellis is a twelve-year-old intellectual prodigy with mild telekinetic abilities. Luke is preparing to enter a prestigious university but, unfortunately, is abducted into the Institute, hidden in a forest in Maine. The Institute houses a number of kids of various ages who either have telekinesis or telepathy and are subjected to a series of experiments.

The Institute has a playground surrounded by a chainlink fence and cameras peering down at two corners. Luke feels the playground looks like a prison exercise yard for kids. Luke makes a number of friends there, and they kindly explain the situation and the Institute's operations to him. 

The kidnapped children in the Institute have special talents â€” telekinesis and telepathy. They are given many tests and injections, and their physical and mental states will be monitored. The children will spend some time in the Front Half and eventually graduate from the Back Half, where they will perform certain services assigned to them. Then, their memories will be wiped, and they will be sent home.

With assistance from one of the Institute's staff and his new friend, Luke runs away from the Institute, hoping to save his friends by bringing the Institute down. But what twelve-year-old boy can do when the police and the outside world are still looking for him after the abduction? And will Tim trust Luke's story when Luke encounters him?

## Personal Thoughts
- I assumed Stephen King likes to include twin girls in his stories.
This reminds me of Lord of the Flies, where a group of kids with different personalities is in a confined area. Things will get interesting when clashing personalities happen, especially when there is nowhere to go.
I was touched by Mattie's kindness when Luke was in the freight. He chose to believe in Luke's story and left him a bag of food. I wonder how many of us can do the same if we encounter a lost boy with a ridiculous story.
- There is always a weird or half-sane person nobody believes in. but when their conspiracy theories become real, it makes everyone look like an idiot. Orphan Annie is an interesting character.
- I don't like Avery's ending, but the last line and what he did was beautiful.
Many people think a story can only be considered horror if it involves ghosts and spirits. I personally feel the human's evil side and the hidden demon inside us are more horrifying because we can't prepare for the unexpected, and the hurt caused by the evil deed is so real.
