## Summary
- Introduce the different residents with their daily lives before everything shuts on the Dome Day.
- The Dome closed the area between Chester's Mill and Motton.
- Barbie, an ex-army drifter, is assigned by his old boss to find the generator which possibly created the Dome. He is promoted to Colonel and is in charge of the town.
- Andy, Jim, and Pastor Coggins are dealing with drugs. The income goes to Andy's drugstore, the church and the funeral home. They use more than half of the town's resources for the meth business. 
- Second Selectman of Chester's Mill, Big Jim kills Pastor Coggins after Pastor Coggins tells him that the Dome was caused by their sins. He wants to reveal to the town about their drug business. Big Jim's son, Junior, handles the corpse, and they plan to frame several other murders on Barbara.
- Big Jim orders the grocery store to be closed until further notice. This creates panic, leading the town residents to lose their minds, and they start to riot.

### Personal Thoughts
- Various multidimensional characters. The funny thing is most stories nowadays have fewer characters than this story, but most of the writers failed to create any multidimensional characters. 
- There are so many things going on from the beginning of the story. There are also many perspectives taken into account, such as from the normal residents with their daily lives, the government with some scientists who try to investigate the unknown disaster, and politicians who only put their position and personal agenda as the first priority. The story even includes anxious dogs, depressed animals, and a mixture of emotions among the residents. 
- The town is so lively and realistic with the number of characters and various personalities.
- It touches on various angles of human basic behaviour when dealing with the unexpected. Some seek spiritual guidance, which divides into two different directions, one towards love and another towards extremity. Then, politicians and authorities who are looking for this chaos as an advantage to gain more power and to strengthen their position. The angry people are looking for conspiracies which are usually against the higher power and to influence the vulnerable with new ideas.
- The brilliance of getting into a politician's and dictator's mind who creates the chaos and takes advantage and manipulates the fear to increase his power in the town. He bullies the weak and surrounds himself with his own people to strengthen his dictatorship position so he can work comfortably behind his greed.
- My most favourite part is the friendship between the soldier, Ames (outside of the Dome), and the so-called cow-kid, Ollie (confined inside the Dome). It was a very touching story which reflects the beautiful bond between them in such a horrific situation.
