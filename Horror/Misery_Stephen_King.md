# Misery - Stephen King

## Summary
Paul Sheldon is a bestselling novelist. He has a car accident, and his legs are in shattered condition. His number one fan, Annie Wilkes, saves him from the car wreck and brings him home. Annie takes care of Paul, putting IV drips in his arms and a lot of codeine-based drugs in his body. Annie is not only Paul's nurse but also his captor, keeping him prisoner in her isolated house. 

Annie reads his manuscript and doesn't like what Paul has written. The new story upsets Annie, which causes Annie to torture Paul more. What aggravates Annie is her favourite character, Misery, who has an unexpected ending after she finishes reading the latest book of the series. Annie hates the manuscript because it is filled with profanity and blackmails Paul to burn the manuscript if he wants the drugs. Annie also forces Paul to rewrite the novel's ending to revive her beloved character.

Annie's mental state is getting worse as time goes by. Paul becomes addicted to writing a perfect ending that Annie wants but also looking for a way to flee.

## Personal Thoughts
The storyline is intriguing, but the pace is too slow or draggy for me. There are some good parts in the story, but some are difficult to follow. I guess I was impatient with the Misery story but more eager to know what happens next and what will happen to Paul in the end.
