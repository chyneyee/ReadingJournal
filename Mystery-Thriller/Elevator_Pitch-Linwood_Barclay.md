## Storyline
On Monday, a FedEx impostor named Stuart Bland is eager to deliver his script to Sherry D'Agostino. Sherry is the vice president of the creative at Cromwell Entertainment, located on the 33rd floor of the Lansing Tower. Stuart joins the other three people, including Sherry, into the elevator. While Stuart is trying his best to sell his story, the elevator passes all the intended levels and goes to the top. It pauses for a few seconds and falls to the bottom of the shaft. The tragedy kills all four.

Tuesday
A similar elevator incident happens again at the Sycamores Residences, a thirty-story York Avenue apartment tower. The victim is Fanya Petrov, a visiting scientist from Russia who was staying on the twenty-eighth floor. The other boy, Colin, is in the elevator with Fanya after his father misses the elevator. When the elevator suddenly stops, Fanya tries to escape from the elevator car. Unfortunately, the elevator car suddenly resumes going down, and Fanya is not quick enough to save herself, which leads to a horror ending for her.

Wednesday
In front of the Klaxton 49, one of four Manhattan hotels, a bomb in a Prius exploded causing three deaths, including the driver. Three minutes after the taxi explosion,  another elevator incident happens at the twenty-story Gormley Building. A man and a woman initially survived after falling into a pit in the basement. When help is on the way, the elevator car suddenly moves in a downward direction and kills two of them.

Two teenagers are supposed to play a prank on others but end up trapped on top of the car. They shout for help, but nobody hears them because no one dares to take the elevator anymore after the mayor's office has released a statement to halt all the elevators until after a safety inspection.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

- Arla is Barbara's and Headley's daughter.
- Eugene Clement and his wife are shot by Bucky, and Bucky is caught by an FBI agent who is following the Clements.
- Four explosions occurred during the opening of the Top of the Park. Part of the stairways are crumbled, and elevators are not working. During the chaotic moment, it is revealed that Chris Vallins is the mastermind to avenge the death of his mother. Chris kills Glover by knocking him off his feet and through the open elevator doors.
- Chris's mother died of a heart attack when he was twelve years old. The elevators in the building were not working. It caused his mother's health to go up and down the stairs for seven floors daily and also delayed the paramedics' work. Richard Headley's father owned the building, and Richard was the property manager. Richard not only avoided the responsibility of getting the elevators fixed, but he also offered harsh advice to Chris on the day of his mother's death.
- Mayor Headley was found dead due to a heart attack on the 95th floor. Chris threatened him by taking the guests as hostages. Mayor Headley has to take the elevator to the lobby and climb the stairs back to the 97th floor in order to save the people.
- Chris Vallins was shot by the detectives Jerry Bourque and Lois Delgado who were in the same building, initially looking for Glover for information related to Otto.

## Personal Thoughts
- I wanted to say that it's a bit wordy, but I guess that's not the correct description of this book. I feel that nowadays, it's rare to find such a story with in-depth details and multi-dimensional characters. There are a lot of interesting things to read throughout the story.
- Different perspectives - from elevator accidents, journalists, the mayor's office, victims, the suspects, and the impact after the halting of elevators. 
- I have always been a harsh critic of lengthy stories, but it has been quite some time since I felt such satisfaction after reading a book.
