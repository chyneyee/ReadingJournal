## Storyline (Potential Spoiler)
A photo of Wakaba and Odagiri holding hands while leaving a hotel is found on the school noticeboard. The president of PTA has already decided to expel Wakaba. Miyuki tries to defend Wakaba, but the decision is firm. Apparently, the president of PTA has a relationship with the principal. When they are leaving the hotel, Hajime takes a photo of them. He uses the photo against them to reverse the decision to expel Wakaba. However, after a few days, her parents take her back to her village. She will finish school at her village and get married to her fiancé chosen by her parents. 

Hajime and Miyuki receive an invitation to Wakaba's wedding. Susumu wants to go to see Wakaba for the last time. After a rough drive on the rocky mountain roads, three of them arrive at the Ijinkan Village in Aomori Prefecture the day before the wedding.  The village is also known as Hexagonal Village due to the village structure looking like the shape of the Star of David. Each house has a different missing triangle of the Star of David, with the church located in the middle among all the houses.

When they arrive at Wakaba's house, the family members are acting strangely, and Wakaba looks distant. The guests are warned not to wander around the house without permission. At night, when Hajime accompanies Miyuki to go to the bathroom, they find a secret door. Hajime accidentally bumps into the door threshold. He falls into the basement and finds a headless mummy.

The ceremony before the wedding begins at nine at night. The owners of the six mansions had arrived. The bridegroom's face is covered in white cloth. According to the tradition, the bride will spend the night in church, and the groom will spend it in the mansion after dinner.  The bride must be alone in the room and pray until the sun shines while the bridesmaids guard the doors.

The church was built by the Christian missionaries several hundred years ago. Twenty years ago, one of the missionaries who stayed with his seven daughters died in a fire, and the rest left the church. The guest suddenly hears the ringing of the church bell. They rush to the church and find Wakaba lying headless on a bloodstained bed. The wedding dress has some writings stating that the head has been taken by the seventh mummy.

<summary>The Details</summary>

* The church has only one door. When the murder occurred, the door and the windows were locked from inside. The windows on the rooftop have iron bars on them. The victim had been killed from 10 pm to 12 am. She had died before her head was cut off. At the same time, Kiriko is missing.
* According to Jun'ya, every house in the village has a mummy, which is an ancient guardian god. There are seven mummies, including the one in the church. Each of those mummies has a different missing part of the body.
* The next morning, Torao's right leg was cut off, and his body was found in the refrigerator in his house. The murderer leaves a note saying that the revenge of the seventh mummy has not ended yet. The death is estimated to have occurred between 2 and 4 am. He was killed by a sharp thrust of a knife to the heart.
* The detective plans to arrest Mitsuko for Torao's murder. A stray cat suddenly appears with a woman's finger in its mouth. The cat leads them to Mitsuko's body, which has had the left leg cut off. This time the note is about the tears of the seventh mummy, and the blood is not dry yet. Hajime finds out that each victim's missing body part is the same as each mummy's missing part from the victims' house. When Hajime is leaving the church, the cross falls from the top, and Susumu saves him. The cross leaves a threatening note to Hajime.
* Meanwhile, Reiji is worried about his daughter's whereabouts. Mitsuko's cat comes into the room, and he tries to shoo him away. The armour statue collapses, and Kuriko's head is found on the helmet. The note states that Kuriko is the second victim. Her arm has been cut off from the right shoulder to the left armpit. The estimated death is between 10 pm and 12 am on the same day as Wakaba's murder. The strange thing is Reiji's house has a mummy that has a missing abdomen, which is not the same as what Kuriko's missing body part is. Ran Goto keeps the mummy, which has a missing left arm from the shoulder.
* Hajime, Miyuki, and Susumu go to see Wakaba's father to confront him about the village's secret. Hajime reveals that he found cannabis yesterday at the "off-limits" place in the depths of the mountain. The mummies were created in the last few decades because Hajime found out that some of the teeth have traces of treatment. 
* Wakaba's father tells the story of the seven families who gained wealth through cannabis growing by the missionaries, which occurred a hundred years ago. Twenty-seven years ago, when the pastor couple started to feel guilty and wanted to burn the cannabis field, the villagers hit the couple. They trapped their seven adopted daughters in the church and burned them until they became mummies. However, each body had a part of the body cut off when they were brought out from the fire. Each of the family brought the mummy back to their house so that no one will betray each other. The secret has been kept for 27 years. The seventh mummy is enshrined in the basement of the chapel.
* Based on Hajime's reasoning, there must be someone who calls himself "The Seventh Mummy" to take revenge for the family. 
* Wakaba's father later died of a heart attack. Meanwhile, Mrs Goto kidnaps Miyuki for personal reasons. A mysterious man killed her and set the Tower House on fire. When Kindaichi, Susumu and the detective run into the house to look for Miyuki, they find Ran Goto's whole left arm cut off from the right shoulder. They were able to rescue Miyuki from the fire. The next day, they found a knife from Reiji's collection from the ruins of the house.

<summary>The Ending</summary>

* Hajime gathers everyone at The Weather Vane House to reveal the killer before he commits the last murder.
* Hajime retells the history of the missionaries and the cannabis field. He believes that out of seven daughters, one girl is still alive. He recreates the different dismemberments of body parts on different dolls and assembles all the parts to create the seventh doll. The girl is probably dead, but her hatred of seeing the whole family being burnt has been inherited by someone else. 
* Hajime analyses that Kiriko is the first victim because Waraba killed Kiriko. The first headless body belongs to Kiriko. Waraba never went into the church. She was able to persuade Kiriko to go into the church with some excuses. Kiriko put on the wedding gown and went inside the church. From the windows on top of the roof, Wakaba put a cloth with chloroform on Kiriko's face. Then, she hooked the ropes to the four ends of the bed. She uses Susumu's SUV and the long cable to do so. When the bed was lifted up to the window, she reached through to cut Kiriko's head off and took the head through the skylight. 
* The real culprit kills Wakaba after Kiriko is murdered. The real culprit rang the bell, and everyone went to the church to create his alibi. When everyone opened the church's door, the culprit sneaked away to meet Wakaba at the place they had promised. He killed her and later carried Wakaba's body back to the church to swap with Kiriko's body. Then, he severed Wakaba's head and hid both Kiriko's body and Wakaba's head.
* Twenty-seven years ago, Jun'ya cut the different parts of six mummies from the fire to create the seventh mummy. This is to create the scene that the fire has killed all seven daughters of the pastor.  Jun'ya admitted that he found Shiori alive and he drove her to the hospital. He committed the horrible act to avoid suspicion from others that Shiori had escaped.
* Hajime reveals that Susume is the seventh mummy because Susume is the son of Shiori, Ryuichi Rokusei. The real Susumu Odagiri is already dead. The skeleton that was found near their school a few months ago belongs to Susumu Odagiri. The skeleton was discovered earlier than his prediction, forcing him to speed up Wataba's marriage by creating the scandalous photo of them coming out from the hotel. 
* After all the crimes are revealed in front of Ryuichi, he attacks the police and takes Miyuki as a hostage. He reveals his sad childhood, and his mother told him that he was born to take revenge for her. He was trained by his mother in several ways to commit murder. Her final lesson is to kill her.
* With Miyuki as his hostage, he uses a gun to kill his last victim, Reiji. Then, he runs to the cannabis field, bringing Miyuki along. He wanted to burn the cannabis field as his final act. Wakaba's fiancé suddenly appears and stabs Ryuichi. Ryuichi fires his gun at him. Hajime hears the gunshot and fights with Ryuichi, which causes Hajime to get shot. During the last moment, Ryuichi admitted in tears that he felt remorse for killing Wakaba, who gave up everything for such a useless man like him. 
* Jun'ya fires several shots at Ryuichi. He admitted that Ryuichi is his son with Shiori. Then, Jun'ya set the cannabis field on fire.
* According to the police, all the body parts were dumped like trash, but Wakaba's head was buried under a stone which was surrounded by beautiful scenery. The forensic team found no sign of struggle put up by Wakaba when she was strangled by Ryuichi. She knew Ryuichi would eventually kill her.
