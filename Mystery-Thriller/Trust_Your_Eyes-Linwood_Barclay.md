# Trust Your Eyes - Linwood Barclay

## Summary
Ray's father, Adam Kilbride, just passed away after an accident when mowing the lawn. Ray has a younger brother, Thomas, who is a map-obsessed schizophrenic. Ray has to think about what to do with Thomas, who will live alone without his father's care. Thomas doesn't want to leave the house; he only wants to spend his entire day with Whirl360, a software program where he can click on different streets and travel around the world on the computer. According to Thomas, he's working for Central Intelligence and memorising maps and street plans. 

Then, one day, Agent Parker and Agent Driscoll from the FBI pay the Kilbrides a visit. They're looking for Thomas after he had emailed the CIA about a computer virus. Thomas has been thinking he is constantly communicating with the CIA and President Clinton. He has been sending them the progress report. Since then, Thomas can only email the CIA with his brother's permission. But what if Thomas sees a crime via Whirl360? What is Ray going to do after Thomas shows him an alleged murder on the screen?

<summary>The Ending</summary>
  
Nine months ago, Allison Fitch shared an apartment with Courtney, an office girl working in trading. Allison is a waitress. She hardly earns enough money to pay for her rent, where she sleeps on the couch. When she gets money from her mother, she uses it for vacation instead of paying Courtney, making their relationship tense. Allison is looking for another reason to ask for money from her mother until she sees Morris Sawchuck, attorney general for the State of New York, on TV. 

Howard Talliman has been Morris's best friend since a kid and now is the advisor for both Morris and Bridget. Allison's target is Bridget, Morris's wife. Bridget confessed to Howard that she had an affair with Allison, and now she is being blackmailed by Allison for a hundred thousand dollars. Howard is worried that another dark secret of Morris's will be exposed after Allison mentions that she heard something, probably from Bridget's phone conversation with Morris when they were together.

For years, Howard has employed Lewis, the former New York police officer, to handle problematic situations. Lewis suggests Howard get rid of Allison once and for all if he doesn't want the problem to continue. Nicole is hired to kill Allison. Thomas saw the murder from Whirl360 and showed it to Ray. Ray goes to Allison's house after Thomas insists that Ray check on the apartment.

Lewis informs Howard that the wrong target was murdered. Allison fled once she came home and saw what happened. She appears in the news as a missing person. Meanwhile, Ray goes to Allison's house, and the neighbour tells him the place has been empty for several months. Lewis installed a surveillance camera in front of Allison's apartment and saw Ray with the printout. Lewis wonders how much Ray knew about the murder and why he was knocking on that apartment's door. 

The worst is the image of the smouldered head still exists on Whirl360. Nicole kills Kyle Billings's wife after threatening him to erase the picture that showed the murder. Kyle is one of the top developers in Whirl360. He got killed by Nicole as well.

The wrong target is revealed as Bridget. Allison was killed in front of a motel after her colleague innocently called her mother to tell her whereabouts.

Lewis tracks down to where Ray lives, and he and Nicole go to his house in Vermont. They plan to kidnap him so that Howard can interrogate Ray, wondering how much he knows. Before that, Nicole senses that Lewis wants to kill her after she has screwed up the murder mission.

When Howard questions Ray and Thomas, Morris discovers the location and wonders what Howard is doing there. Thomas and Ray reveal the truth about Bridget's murder, and Morris is shocked by the revelation. Lewis shoots Nicole, but without his knowledge, she is wearing a bulletproof vest.

Lewis shoots Morris because Morris doesn't want to get involved with the murders. Nicole attacks Lewis with an ice pick when Lewis intends to shoot Ray. When Nicole wants to shoot Ray, Ray picks up a dart and stabs her in the neck.

Harry Peyton used to attempt a sexual assault on Thomas when he was a kid. Ray's father never believed Thomas until he found explicit images from Peyton's phone. Peyton acts as Bill Clinton, talking to Thomas to ensure that Thomas is still in his delusional world and doesn't reveal the secret to Ray. Peyton committed suicide in his office. Later, it revealed that Thomas shoved his father on the hill and didn't get immediate help after feeling upset about having to tell the police about Mr Peyton.
