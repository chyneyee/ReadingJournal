# The Good Daughter (The Good Daughter #1) - Karin Slaughter

## Summary
### Thursday, March 16, 1989
- Eight days ago, Gamma, Samantha, and Charlotte experienced life change when the house was burnt by the attack of the Molotov cocktail.
- Ezekiel Whitaker, a Black man wrongly convicted of murdering a white woman, walked out of prison the same day that a burning bottle of kerosene had been thrown through the Quinn's bay window. 
- Rusty now represent white man from a trashy family of kidnapping and raping a nineteen-year-old girl from a good family. The girl committed suicide. Samantha is in the same school with the girl's brother.
- Two men in ski masks come into the house and kill Gamma. One of them, named Zach, and Samantha thought of Zachariah Culpepper, the name she read from her father's case files. Rusty defends him from going to jail for years. Rusty refused to go after him for the unpaid legal bills.
- Sam tries to convince them to let them go, and they won't tell anyone. Zach and the Hightop guy have an argument, which creates an opportunity for Charlie to run. An explosive sound occurs, and when Sam wakes up, she realises she's being buried alive.

### 28 Years Later
- Charlie is a defence attorney. She witnesses a horror shooting in the school. She is there to get back the phone from a teacher, Huck, that she accidentally swiped last night after a one-night stand.
- The horror shooting triggers the trauma she experienced 28 years ago. It also reveals some of the details of what happened to her after she escaped from the two kidnappers after her sister Sam was buried alive.
- Kelly, a sixteen-year-old girl, shot a coach and a little girl in the school.
- Daniel Culpepper, Zach's brother, was shot twenty-eight years ago when Officer Coin tracked him in the trailer. The gun, which was found in Daniel's hand, was later identified as the same weapon that had been used to shoot Sam in the head.
- Sam is also an attorney. Their father is stabbed and in the hospital. He asks Sam to help him handle the arraignment and talk to the shooter. He believes that Kelly is innocent despite both sisters disagreeing with it.

## Personal Thoughts
- Monotonous writing. Too many irrelevant details for every action and object, even a table or a chair.
- The story about the day of the crime repeats again for the other character. Why do we have to read the same content again until a certain point?
- The characters are one-dimensional.
- I didn't realise I bought this book many years ago, and when I found this recently, I chose to read this before I forgot it again. From the very beginning, this book seems dull and beats around the bush with so many irrelevant details. I stayed until the end because I didn't want to waste what I bought, and I wanted to know the ending of the case.
- Occasionally, the writer throws in some overly detailed fun facts that I'm not interested in knowing, such as the tannin content in wines and what tannin is. Even the injuries of Sam are more than should be known. It's like the effort for the research shouldn't be wasted and should be thrown into the book regardless of whether the readers are interested in reading it or not.
- Now I understand why other readers are complaining about the logical part despite it being fictional. There are so many things that seem just thrown in by the writer, and she made them up as the story progressed. Out of nowhere, the writer decided this specific character is transgender, and not that it's relevant to the story, and there's no brief mention beforehand. It's just totally out of nowhere.
- Too much filler and repetitive backstory.
- None of the characters are likeable. 
- Sam keeps pushing Charlie, the younger sister, to have a happy life even when Charlie's life is in a miserable state so that she can feel that what she's been through is worthy. How can you force a person to be happy when she has no control over her life? She has the right to be sad when bad things happen to her. Not that I like Charlie because she's an adult and an attorney, but she talks and behaves like a teenager. 
- The ending is pathetically funny. As usual, there are so many sudden and unconvincing plot twists.
