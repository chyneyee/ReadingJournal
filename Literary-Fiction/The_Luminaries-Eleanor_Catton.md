The novel's structure is based on Western astrology. Each of the twelve local men represents one of the twelve signs of the zodiac, and another set of characters represents planets in the Solar System.

The story's background setting is during the New Zealand gold rush of the 1860s, focusing on the West Coast goldfields. The twelve men were gathered together by their association to the events of the 14th of January - the night Anna Wetherell had nearly died, Crosby Wells had died, Emery Staines had vanished, Francis Carver had sailed away, and Alistair Lauderback had arrived in town. The twelve plus Moody (who just arrived at Hokitika to try to make a fortune digging for gold), took an oath that they would keep the information of that night's conference at Crown Hotel as secret.

## Personal Thoughts
- The local residents of a town were involved in a series of mysteries: murder, revenge, disappearance, blackmail, and suspicious suicide. They need to investigate the background of the widow, Lydia Wells who claimed that she was the wife of the deceased, Crosbie Wells. If the marriage certificate is legal, the sale of Crosbie's land will be revoked and the fortune will be hers. Another mystery to solve is why Anna was left half dead on the street which initially appeared as a suicide attempt. Also, who is Frank Wells or Carver and what is his role in this mystery?
- The only part I disliked was the jumpiness of the events which made me even more confused with the timeline. I was easily distracted when the storyline suddenly offered a detailed explanation of the character's background to justify his action at that time. Maybe it's on purpose because later on, Moody felt the same thing about Balfour's narration of the story.
- I gave 3/5 for the story. The story wasn't badly written but I'm not a fan of lengthy stories. I would enjoy the story more if it's written in sequential order without retelling the story and the ending part which returns to the past to unravel the mystery. Due to the unusual narration style, it feels like I understood the story in a confused and unconvincing manner. An extra one for the writer because of the multi-layered narratives and the in-depth cultural and historical elements which I'm sure the writer must have put an enormous effort in research when writing this book.
