# Dance Dance Dance (The Rat #4) - Haruki Murakami

## Summary
- The narrator is experiencing strange dreams about the Dolphin Hotel, where he stayed four and a half years ago for a week with a woman. He explained the details of the hotel's condition and said it was not a pleasant place to return. However, the narrator believes the strange dreams of the hotel are a calling from the woman who had suddenly disappeared after leading him to stay at the Dolphin Hotel. 
- Then, he recalls his life after a series of incidents happened to him during the previous autumn (based on the earlier book The Rat #3). He also reveals that he finally finds out the woman's name and decides to return to the Dolphin Hotel to look for her.
- The narrator is dumbfounded when he sees the old Dolphin Hotel has turned into a grand and luxurious hotel with the old name being retained. He is very keen to look for the answer to such a drastic change and the fate of the previous owner.
- The receptionist recalls a strange incident that she encountered on level 15. When this peculiar event occurs to the narrator, he sees the Sheep Man. The Sheep Man leaves vague messages about knots and connections and advises him to keep dancing.
- When the narrator returns to Tokyo, he continues searching for the girl who vanished without a trace but leaves a deep impression on him since she left.
- While looking for the disappeared woman, he met Gotanda, an old schoolmate who became a famous actor who could offer more information about the woman.
- Yuki is a thirteen-year-old girl with famous parents who was abandoned by her mother, who flew to Kathmandu for her work. The hotel receptionist arranged for the narrator to look after Yuki while they flew back to Hokkaido.

## Personal Thoughts
- Everyone seems so lost in their lives, like spending their daily time aimlessly.
- Two men keep complaining and comparing their miserable lives.
- I enjoyed reading the book in the simplicity of the words but not the story itself.
- Honestly, I don't know how to appreciate the brilliance of this story as other readers did. I don't like stories with too much sexual content and overly vague. The middle part got draggy and boring, and I just couldn't connect with the story. I believe the story has many hidden meanings, but I really couldn't grasp those.
- Maybe I need the Sheep Man to connect me to the author's mind to understand the meaning behind the story.
