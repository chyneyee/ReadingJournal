# Storyline
Set in Houston, Joe Buck is grooming himself in perfection, dressing up like a cowboy, before leaving the hotel. He heads to the Sunshine Cafeteria with his suitcase and tells his workmate that he's going to the East, where women in the East are willing to pay for men.

The story recounts Joe's childhood, from being abandoned by his mother when he was 7 to losing his virginity at 17. His entire childhood was surrounded by women, but not many male adults who could set an example for him. This leads him to live in confusion without anyone to ask for answers to during his adolescent life. Living his life filled with loneliness and hunger for affection, his maturity development is slower than his peers, and his nativity continues until adulthood.

Then, a betrayal from Joe's assumed friend angered him and motivated him to head to New York City. When he arrives in New York by bus, he checks into the hotel. He writes a postcard to express the excitement of his arrival in New York but later only realised he has no addressee. At Park Avenue, he sees a wealthy lady and tries to attract her with his charm. The wealthy lady is not only uninterested but feels Joe should be ashamed of himself. 

Later, he tries again for a different woman, and this time, the lady with a poodle named Cass Trehune is interested in his advance and lures him to follow her to her posh apartment. After they have finished the business, Cass is busy preparing for a dinner rendezvous, and Joe tries to ask the payment for his service. Cass doesn't have money and feels insulted that Joe's request means her young age needs a male hustler. She bursts into tears, and Joe consoles her, giving her twenty dollars for her taxi fare and telling her that it was just a joke and his father is an oilman from Texas. 

When drinking in another bar and thinking of getting someone's advice for his problem, he meets a crippled swindler called Rico Rizzo from the Bronx. Joe tells his problem to Rico, and Rico suggests that Joe should get an agent to get clients for him. Rico takes $20 from Joe and introduces him to Mr O'Daniel. Joe appreciates Rico's help and is grateful that Mr O'Daniel is very accepting, but later only finds out that Mr O'Daniel is not what he thought. Joe runs out of the room and looks for Rico, but he can't remember the hotel's name.

Joe's money is running out, and the hotel locks him out of his room. He has to clear the bill before the hotel returns back his belongings. He wanders homelessly for several weeks but remains fit and hygienic. One afternoon, when Joe walks around, he encounters Rico or Ratso at a diner.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

From excitement to anger, Joe releases his rage on Ratso but does not intend to avenge what Ratso did to him. Joe leaves the diner, but Ratso offers him a place to stay. It's an evacuated flat with X-taped windows where he is squatting. Joe reluctantly accepts the offer and is glad he finally has a decent place to sleep.

Ratso and Joe form an alliance to find ways for their survival. Although they have a hard life, for the first time, Joe feels happy. He doesn't need to yearn for attention and finds friendship and companionship in Ratso. As time goes by, Ratso's health worsens.

One December night, Joe receives an invitation to a party from Hansel and Gretel MacAlbertson and brings Ratso along. Joe gets high off after taking the pill that Gretel gives him. Joe is leaving with a socialite willing to pay him $20 for a night. Ratso, already unwell before the party, falls down the stairs and goes home alone.

After he leaves the woman's apartment, he buys new underwear and socks, medicine, soup, and cigarettes for Ratso. When Joe returns home, he finds Ratso appearing feverish, bedridden and unable to walk. Joe plans to go to Florida with Ratso on that night.

Joe wanders on the street to look for clients as they need more money for the trip. Then, a middle-aged man, Townsend, comes from Chicago and asks him to have dinner together. Townsend takes Joe back to his hotel and talks non-stop to him. After wasting his time for several hours with his talking, Townsend decides to pull out from the plan when Joe confronts him. The next day, after sending Ratso to the bus station, Joe runs to the hotel where Townsend is staying. Townsend is willing to give him $10, but Joe needs more than that for the trip to Florida. In desperation, Joe attacks Townsend and robs his money.

The bus will take thirty-one hours to reach Florida. During the journey, Joe promises Ratso that he will stop hustling and find a proper job in Florida to take care of Ratso. Ratso's health is deteriorating. His entire body is in pain, becomes incontinent and unresponsive. Joe buys new clothes for himself and Ratso. He even changes Ratso's pants and realises his body is in a bad state. Shortly before arrival, Joe wakes up to discover that Ratso has died.

# Personal Opinions
- No superfluous writing and straightforward. Some descriptions can be vague and require analysis.
- Joe is a sad and pathetic character that others like to take advantage of. It's a memorable character because the writer brilliantly expresses Joe's raw emotions throughout the story.
- It's a beautiful story of two troubled men who solve each other's loneliness through friendship and companionship.
- Despite Joe disliking Ratso's unhonest work and living in despair, Ratso still steals a winter coat as a Christmas present for Joe. Although Joe refuses to accept it as he knows where it comes from, I found it touching that Ratso tries to get a Christmas present for Joe in such a tough time. This indicates he really appreciates Joe as a friend.
- Besides Joe's random male clients, I don't feel the existence of a homosexual relationship between Joe and Ratso. For me, what they have is a beautiful friendship or probably to the extent of brotherhood.
- I felt touched by Joe's promise to care for Ratso by getting a proper job. He even changes Ratso's dirty pants on the bus when Ratso is no longer responsive.
- No doubt, it has a sad ending. However, I try to find the optimism behind it. Joe finally experiences a friendship that he has been seeking in his life, and it's not only a friendship; it's the best companionship with someone who went through bad times with him. I'm glad that Joe has ditched his cowboy outfit, no longer needs a mirror to do his thinking, and has plans. He starts to become more responsible and has a plan for his future, new life, much better than when he left Houston.
