# The Harmony Silk Factory - Tash Aw

## Summary
### Part 1 - Jasper
- Harmony Silk Factory is the name of the shophouse bought in 1942 as a front for Jasper's father's illegal businesses. Jasper's family lived in a house separated from the factory by a small mossy courtyard. Eventually, the house also became known as the Harmony Silk Factory due to the increasing number of visitors.
- Jasper is going to retell the history of his father's terrible past, which he named "The True Story of the Infamous Chinaman Called Johnny."
- It was rumoured that Johnny was born in 1920, the year of the riots in Taiping, where Hakkas and Hokkiens were fighting over a newly discovered mine. At the start of his life, his real name was Lim Seng Chin, but he chose the name Johnny in late 1940. Johnny is a young activist. During the 1940s, he prepared lectures and pamphlets and even reported activities on the Malayan Communist Party in newspapers. At that time, it was not unusual for many poor Chinese to become Communists.
- Jasper hinted at his admiration for his father, who later became a textile merchant despite coming from a modest background. In between, Jasper also connected some of his childhood memories with his narration about Johnny.
- In 1933, Johnny killed a man, and the rumour was he did it in self-defence. At this stage, Johnny was working in the tin mine. The British hired Johnny because of his exceptional skill in machinery. A misunderstanding between Johnny and the British led to a physical attack. Although the criminal charges were dismissed, one of the British men later died due to the earlier incident. This is probably the first incident indirectly pushing Johnny to the unthinkable path - Communist.
- Throughout Jasper's account of his father, he loathed his father's crimes. He considered his father a heartless man, and everyone feared Johnny.

### Part 2 - Snow
- Snow's diary begins on 25th September 1941.
- Snow decided to leave her husband. She knew the marriage wouldn't last long after few days married to Johnny. She recalled some memories of Johnny and his awkwardness with his family and friends at the party.
- Peter is introduced in Snow's diary but not much details about him is given in the beginning. He's probably Johnny's friend, but what we know is Snow didn't have good impressions on him.
- The diary focuses on Snow's inner feelings about her marriage and her observations about Johnny. The diary later focused on their late honeymoon to the Seven Maidens, accompanied by Honey, Peter and Mamoru.
- Throughout the journey, Snow has feelings for knowledgeable Mamoru. She probably felt that Mamoru is the only hope if she leaves Johnny. At the end of the diary, Snow mentioned that she has to accept her fate married to Johnny after what happened between her and Mamoru.

### Part 3 - Peter
- Peter is living in a nursing home in Malacca. He alternatively talks about the garden he plans to build and reminisces about the past especially his friendship with Johnny. Peter offers his version of the trip to the Seven Maidens and the real purpose of the journey. This revelation also provides the real side of Johnny.

## Personal Notes
- Storytelling has a very smooth transition from one story to another.
- Delicate, refined with a beautiful story and rich with history.
- It certainly brings the readers back to the 1930s in Malaya.
- I liked how the narration style has been baiting me several times, wondering what crimes the father had committed that were so unforgivable and despised by the son.
- It's great to read the multiple perspectives about Johnny. From Jasper's perspective of his father, Johnny seems like a masculine figure and is viewed as a hero by the locals, respectable but fearful by many people. He views his mother as an unhappy wife because of Johnny's heartless and despicable character. From Snow's perspective of her husband, the husband seems uncomfortable living in their social circle and too inferior married to her, as if she's too good for him. Snow was indeed unhappy in her marriage, but it was different from what Jasper thought.
- To be honest, the entire story is intriguing, even though I only enjoyed reading Jasper's account. Snow's part is monotonous, probably because she is too focused on her feelings. Peter's account is lengthy and jumpy between his current and past life. After finishing the story, there are more questions unanswered and some inconsistencies with the storyline.
- It's a great lesson to see things from different perspectives and view from multiple angles. It's better to listen to more than one side of the story.
