# Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche - Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum (Translator), Philip Gabriel (Translator)

## Summary
After reading a reader's letter from a magazine, the writer Haruki Murakami decided to interview the survivors of the Tokyo subway sarin attack by the cult movement Aum Shinrikyo, which occurred in 1995. The interviews were conducted with the utmost respect for the affected ones, and the writer assured them that their narration would be preserved in the book.

The interviews offered different accounts, from train station workers to the affected passengers, and each was detailed with various backgrounds and opinions about the incident. The final interviews in the book are with Aum's former or current members, allowing the readers to understand what kind of people were attracted to the cult and their thoughts about the religion before and after the incident.

This book is filled with raw emotions that are so real. None of us 
can imagine the scale of the aftermath. Still, the writer did an excellent job of detailing the incident while preserving the narrator's storytelling style. Recalling the pain, the suffering, and the sarin smell really needs a lot of courage from the affected ones.
