# The Enchanted April - Elizabeth von Arnim

# Storyline
Mrs. Wilkins sees an advertisement in the newspaper seeking someone to rent a small mediaeval Italian Castle. She is eager for such a holiday, but she doesn't have the money. Her husband is a solicitor, firmly pressing the importance of being thrifty to prepare for the future.

Mrs. Arbuthnot seems absorbed by the same advertisement in the club. Mrs. Wilkins plucks her courage to approach Mrs. Arbuthnot and suggests they share the cost of renting the castle. Mrs. Arbuthnot initially hesitates due to her intolerance to selfish pleasure. She finds it uncomfortable with Mrs. Wilkins's strange behaviour during their first interaction.

To reduce the rent, they advertised in the newspaper to inquire for two more ladies to join them and share the expenses. In contrast with Mrs Wilkins, who is excited about the trip, Mrs Arbuthnot is guilty of leaving the poor for her holidays. However, once they arrived in Italy, any guilt or unhappy thoughts about their lives immediately faded.

When they arrive in San Salvatore, it is clear that there is a clash of personalities among the four women. Mrs. Wilkins, who used to put her husband as the highest priority, has lost her timidity and enjoys her freedom without doing anything. Mrs. Arbuthnot, who always helps the poor and used to work for the church, finds it hard to have the opportunity to serve others. Meanwhile, Lady Caroline, whose beauty enchanted everyone around her, travels to Italy with the wish of being left alone. Feeling lost and struggling with the troubles caused by her beauty, she wishes to have a peaceful life by isolating herself from others for a month. Mrs. Fisher is an educated elderly widow who feels the need to be respected and strongly requires the importance of mannerisms. The only thing she shares with Lady Caroline is high self-esteem, looking down on Mrs Wilkins and Mrs Arbuthnot, and both actually have an emptiness inside them.

# Personal Thoughts
- I don't know whether I should feel Mrs. Wilkins is annoying or amusing. I don't know whether I should sympathise or loathe her ignorance.
- The eloquent in describing the emotions and feelings in beautiful prose and the accuracy of the chosen vocabulary.
- Four women with different backgrounds and social status. Somehow, I feel the higher class are using their pride and confidence to stamp their authority on those women of modest and lower social classes.
- The portrayal of the generation gap and the differences between the old and young were brilliantly captured in the story. The grumpiness and the authoritarian figure of Mrs. Fisher, the pride of Lady Caroline, who seems lost with her direction of life despite being admired by everyone, and the disapproval of Mrs. Fisher with Lady Caroline were portrayed extremely well of how most older generations view the later generations.
- Besides the generation gap, the marriage differences between Mrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot were one of the story's highlights. Mrs. Wilkins has a rich lawyer husband who is stingy to spend money on her and treats her less than a wife. Meanwhile, Mrs. Arbuthnot has a writer husband who doesn't mind spending money on her, but their relationship is distanced by their conflicting views about his job, although she has more freedom than Mrs. Wilkins.
- Suitable for light reading, especially during holidays when you need to read something pleasant and slow.
