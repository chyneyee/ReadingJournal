# Surveillance State: China's Quest to Launch a New Era of Social Control - Josh Chin, Liza Lin

## Introduction
- This book is the end product of five years of reporting in China, the United States, Africa, and other locations.
- Combined experience of twenty-five years of experience living in and reporting on China.
- The content is divided into four parts which discuss the platform, back to the future, trade winds, and the China solution.
- In other parts of China, police often are unarmed and under-trained, functioning more as glorified security guards. 
- In Xinjiang, the doorstep of Central Asia, the police were brutal and well-armed. Digital censors were installed across the region to monitor Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.
- The spreading of surveillance, the biometric data collection, and the disappearances of people to the shadowy schools.
- Xinjiang has been China's most fractious region where deadly violence occasionally occurs between Uyghurs and Han Chinese migrants. The territory is under control using a combination of internment camps, brainwashing, and mass surveillance.
- Futuristic technologies implemented to re-engineer a religious minority but not eradicate it.
- Under Xi, the Party believes that by mining insight from surveillance data, it can predict what people want without having to give them a vote or a voice.

## Part I
- Collecting personal data from the Uyghurs which include the number of times attending the prayer ritual and the venue of the mosque, details of contacts abroad, whether the person holds a passport and travelled overseas before, etc.
- Police are forcing Uyghurs to turn over their passports which had evidence of travelling to a Muslim country before.
- Under Mao, security was enforced, and the influence of minority populations was diluted by encouraging waves of Han migration. Mao's radical politics believed that ethnicity was an "obstacle to progress". The Party aggressively eradicates Uyghur traditions that interfere with assimilation causing massive protests.
- In 2014, internal passports were introduced to restrict the movements of Uyghurs around Xinjiang.
- Before 2001, Chinese leaders saw Xinjiang as a product of ethnic tensions. After the 9/11 attacks, the Party rebranded its struggle with the Uyghurs as a battle against terrorism and religious extremism. Religious extremism is to be blamed for any public strife.
- Gathered intelligence will be weaponized and turned into the integrated joint-operations platform. The data-management platform used in Xinjiang was similar to the terrorist-predicting system.
- Standardizing the behaviours of Uyghurs by the majority of Han Chinese using the method of "brainwashing" or reprogramming them.

## Part II 
- Using the Great Chinese Famine as an example, economist Amartya Sen argued that a functioning democratic system can prevent famine because the leaders will take action to end the mass starvation to avoid the prospect of election defeat. In China, censorship and propaganda hide the reality of the disaster from the regular people and officials.
- Since 2016, surveillance cameras have multiplied and expanded to Tibetan monasteries and remote villages around the country.
- Data and technology used for predictions and contingency planning.
- The Party ensured only Chinese companies would handle the country's data. As long as tech companies obeyed censorship orders, internet companies were given more freedom than other industries.
- Internet companies such as Alibaba which has all its users' information are sharing the data with the authorities for any possible threat.
- The Chinese law sets the responsibility of content control and scrutiny to the internet companies. Failure to do so will risk losing their licence to run the business.
- The government knows every activity of its citizens, including what they buy, and where they will go for vacation.

## Part III
- Chinese surveillance systems have expanded to the outside world at a rapid speed. A Chinese company has sold the entire surveillance system to Uganda. 
- Surveillance or tracking systems may help governments control their populations but the deployed technology is more being utilised by local politics for personal gain.
- Exporting surveillance was an attempt to undermine the notion that democracy is the only acceptable form of government to which a country can aspire.
- New technology is easier to test in China than in Western countries, which usually with long and regulation-heavy processes.
- Many American companies reap profits from China's surveillance systems through investments in Chinese startup companies.
- The accuracy rate of identifying the right person fell in dark conditions, when images were blurry or when the people weren't directly facing the camera. Facial recognition algorithms were less accurate at identifying dark-skinned people.
- Algorithms are never perfect because humans design them and choose which training data to feed them.
- In the US, law enforcement agencies try to avoid losing access to surveillance systems. On the other hand, privacy activists and lawyers push for bans on facial recognition systems despite their usefulness in helping police track down bad guys.

## Part IV
- Panopticon (Greek word panoptes, meaning "all seeing") - a circular prison with hidden surveillance corridors that allowed three guards to monitor six floors of prisoners. In fact, the prison's guards couldn't see everything but that was part of the design. The inmate never knows whether he is being looked at but he must be sure that he may be constantly being watched.
- Gaps exist in Chinese cyberspace, as a result of missing or corrupt data or incompatible databases.
- Most of the data was scattered among thousands of government agencies whose officials and computer systems weren't always compatible with each other.

<br>

## Personal Thoughts
- Thoroughly researched, comprehensive insight, articulately written, and compelling to read. It's an eye-opener for most of us about the state of surveillance systems in China and the severity of the assimilation of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.
- Most readers would probably begin to think about how much of our data has been collected by the country's government and how much our privacy has been invaded without our knowledge.
- It's remarkable when it comes to the part about some of the reputable global technology companies that are involved in the development of tracking systems in China.
