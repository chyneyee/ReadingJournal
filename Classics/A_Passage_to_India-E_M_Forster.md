# A Passage to India - E.M. Forster

## Summary
- Dr. Aziz, an Indian Muslim, is a widower who only sees his three children at his mother-in-law's house. During dinner, Aziz receives a summons from his superior, Major Callendar, the civil surgeon. He arrives at Callendar's house only to find that there is no message for him. Aziz decides to walk home. On the way, he stops at his favourite mosque. Aziz suddenly notices an Englishwoman in the mosque and yells to stop her from trespassing in a holy place for Muslims. The woman explains that she already removed her shoes upon entering and that she realises that God is present in the mosque. The woman introduces herself as Mrs. Moore. She is visiting her son, Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate. They have a short conversation before he escorts her to a whites-only club.
- Mr. Fielding, a British headmaster of the small government-run college for Indians, becomes good friends with Aziz after the tea party at Fielding's house. Aziz feels protective of him and warns him to be less frank with other Indians. He believes there are spies around and worries that Fielding's straightforwardness will cause him to lose his job. However, Fielding doesn't bother much about it.
- Adela is expecting an invitation from Aziz to the Marabar Hills, which Aziz has simply mentioned at Fielding's tea party. Her servant overhears the remark, and the words travel to Aziz. He feels offended and organises the trip. He invites Fielding and Godbole, along with the two ladies, to Marabar. Ronny gives permission for the women to go, as long as Fielding goes along with them.
- Mrs. Moore assures Aziz that the trip still will be successful even without Fielding and Godbole, who both miss the train.
- When they visit the first cave, Mrs. Moore is terrified by the darkness and echoes in the cave. After they come out from the cave, she decides not to proceed to the next set of caves but urges Adela to go ahead with Aziz but without the villagers tagging along. 
- Aziz, Adela, and the guide climb up towards other caves. Aziz's mind is preoccupied with breakfast preparations. Adela is thinking about her marriage and suddenly realises that she and Ronny are not in love. Aziz goes for a smoke and finds out the guide leaves Adela alone to discover one of the caves. He panics and tries to look for her. Fielding arrives and tells Aziz that Miss Derek drove him there. Aziz wants to escort Miss Derek to the camp, but Adela and she have already left the place.
- They depart the place and board the train to return to Chandrapore. When they arrive at the city, Mr. Haq, the inspector of police, boards the train and arrests Aziz and sends him to prison. Mr. Turton informs Fielding that Adela lodges a complaint that she has been sexually assaulted in one of the Marabar Caves. Fielding protests that Aziz is innocent.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

- Mr. McBryde, superintendent of police, receives Aziz politely at the jail. Fielding arrives at McBryde’s to get the details of the case. McBryde explains that Adela has claimed that Aziz followed her into a cave and made advances on her. She hit him with her field glasses, and he broke the strap. McBryde shows Fielding the broken glasses, which the police have found on Aziz’s person. Fielding wants to ask Adela whether she is sure that Aziz attacked her. Callandar refuses to allow him to do so because Adela is ill. Fielding still believes that Aziz is innocent. McBryde tells him that a private letter from a brothel owner was found in Aziz's house. Fielding admits that he himself visited a brothel at Aziz's age. The police found some women's photos in Aziz's bedroom, and Fielding explains that the photos are of Aziz's wife. 
- Anxiety is rising among the English, and the women are worrying about their safety. Fielding insists that Aziz is innocent in exchange for the resignation of his job in India and immediately resigns from the club.
- Later the writer offers us Adela's account of the incident. Adela's memory about her experience in the cave is vague, uncertain, and easily influenced by external forces.
- Adela withdraws her charges against Aziz in the court.

## Personal Thoughts
- The challenging part of reading this book is not the racism but the way the English belittle the Indians and act so superior in a foreign land is so repulsive.
- The English are cynical towards Indians because they feel they're superior and often assume the Indians want to get benefits from them. The Indians, despite disliking them in their hearts, are overly eager to please the foreigners, either not to offend the English, which might cost their jobs, or because they observe some interesting personalities possessed by the English.
The Indians have internal conflicts among themselves due to differences in sects and social status but unite against the English.
- I feel annoyed by Adela's simple thinking, which takes Aziz's words too seriously, and Aziz does too much to make the visitors happy. 
- The entire story seems to be about hypocrisy, where people exchange pleasant words in front of each other while keeping their prejudice inside. 
- The story only reaches its peak when the accusation occurs. Before the peak, there was a tension buildup between two nations and planting seeds into the readers of how both sides think about each other. After the peak, it focuses on the aftermath after the trial.
- I understand the main focus of this story is about the relationship between the British and Indians in the 1920s, but I really don't like the story itself.
