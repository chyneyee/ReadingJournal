# The Citadel - A.J. Cronin

## Storyline
Andrew Manson arrives in Drineffy, a remote Welsh mining community, to take up the post of Doctor Page's assistant in 1924. The journey was taken during a heavy rainstorm, making the scenery bleak and desolate. However, the young Scott is excited and enthusiastic about his first medical career post.

Manson is overwhelmed with several unexpected events on the first day of his arrival. First, he is told that several previous assistants before him kept leaving the post, probably due to overwork. Later, Miss Page, Dr. Page's sister, informs him that Dr. Page is ill, and Manson discovers that the doctor is having a stroke. 

Manson is excited to treat his first patient, but his excitement is shortened when he can't diagnose the illness. At the same time, Doctor Philip Denny, assistant to Doctor Nicholls, enters the surgery room with arrogance and sarcasm about Manson's arrival in this town. He also throws Manson a reality check of practising in the town, such as no ambulance and X-rays, performing operations on a kitchen table, washing in a scullery, lack of sanitation, and kids dying like flies with infantile cholera during summer.

The following day, Manson discovers an outbreak of typhoid fever in Glydar Place, where he treated his first patient the day before. There is neither a hospital nor an isolation ward, and the district medical officer is nowhere to be found. Despite his loathing of Dr. Denny, Manson has to ask for his advice before the outbreak worsens.

Manson's cases are under control, whereas some of Denny's patients died in the outbreak caused by the sewer leak. Denny suggests blowing up the old sewer so that a new one will be built, and Andrew hesitantly has to go along with the plan.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

- After an argument with Miss Page, Manson resigns and works as an assistant in a miners' medical aid scheme in Aberalaw, a neighbouring coal mining town in the South Wales coalfield. He marries Christine, a junior school teacher.
- On the first day of arriving in Aberalaw, the head doctor, Doctor Llewellyn, informs Manson that Manson needs to pay a fifth of his income to Doctor Llewellyn because he has to provide aid for some of the assistants' cases.
- In this new town, many workers come to the doctor to request certificates to get compensation money for their unfit for work. Manson refused to give away the certificates, which caused outrage among the patients.
- Manson begins his research on dust inhalation and its effect on miners with the help of his wife. If successful, his research might improve the working conditions and help the miners get compensation if troubled with chest problems.
- His research thesis was printed in the Journal of Industrial Health in England and published as a brochure in the United States by the Association of American Hygiene.
- They decide to move on from the biases given by the people in Aberalaw, and he is appointed as a new medical officer for MFB in London. He is excited that he finally has the opportunity to work on his dust inhalation research, but unfortunately, he is pushed by the management to work on other issues. 
- Manson resigned from the post, and another doctor got the credit for raising the dust inhalation issue, which later became an industrial disease.
- Manson set up his own practice in an impoverished locality. After meeting Frank and his friends, Manson is tempted to reach a higher social status. Although he knew the hay fever vaccine injection was useless, he gave it to a wealthy patient to earn more money.
- Later, Manson was appointed to out-patients at the Victoria Hospital. He becomes money-minded and devours for material success. 
- His relationship with Christine is getting wider apart. While he's chasing the social ladder in the materialistic world, Christine is trying to pull her husband back to his old self. Christine tries to adapt to Manson's world, but it rattles her faith in herself, and she starts to question whether she is the right wife for him.
- Manson is blinded by social status and money. He even has an affair with a socialite who has been helping him a lot in building his social circle in high-class society. 
- The awakening comes when he witnesses a failed operation by his friend, which caused the patient's death. It was the doctor's negligence and incompetence.
- Unfortunately, when Manson gets back on the right path, planning to restart his new life, thinking of working together with his close friends, and his life will be happily ever after with Christine, Manson is struck by the tragedy of Christine's death.

## Personal Thoughts / Notes
- A struggling young doctor who faces various challenges throughout his medical career.
- Part 1: Manson starts his medical career as Doctor Page's assistant in Drineffy. A mistrust from Miss Page leads to the argument, and Manson resigns from the job.
- Part 2: Manson and his wife move to a more prosperous town, Aberalaw and work as a doctor's assistant. He is told to pay one-fifth of his income to the head doctor.
- Part 3: Manson is appointed as a medical officer for CMFB (Coal and Metalliferous Mines Fatigue Board). Unfortunately, the Board assigned him to work on other issues instead of allowing him to work on his dust inhalation research.
- Part 4: He finally set up his own practice, free of the tyranny of the card system. The riches blinded his professionalism, and the greedy world of London medicine claims him, with its private clinics, wealthy, spoilt patients and huge rewards.
- Manson is a doctor who asks why and is willing to do further diagnosis.
- As I continued reading, I realised Manson can be a temperamental person, and his wife has tremendous patience with him. No doubt, he's a great and dedicated doctor, but unfortunately, his unconventional approach was hardly acceptable to most people at that time.
- At the same time, despite being a lengthy reading, I like the storytelling and the writing style, which brilliantly expresses the raw emotions and the human nature of various characters in different circumstances. 
- The ups and lows and the changes of Manson, from modest to aggressively ambitious and money-motivated, are alarming.
