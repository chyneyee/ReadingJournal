# Tokyo Express - Seicho Matsumoto, Jesse Kirkwood (Translator)

## Summary
<b>The Witness</b>

Tatsuo Yasuda was the president of a company that sold industrial machinery. He invited one of his clients to join him at the Koyuki restaurant in Akasaka on the evening of the thirteenth of January.

Toki is a twenty-six-year-old waitress at the Koyuki restaurant. Sometimes, a customer would ambush her as she left the restaurant. She finds it hard to reject her customers' requests, which leads to a meeting that sometimes doesn't go well.

Yasuda offers to take Yaeko and Tomoko (both are waitresses at Koyuki) for a meal the next day. They had their meals at Ginza on Christmas Eve and later agreed to send Yasuda off at Tokyo station, who would leave for Kamakura that evening. While waiting for the train's arrival, they saw Toki in her elegant outfit with a suitcase waiting for the Asakaze Express to Kyushu. She is accompanied by a young man in a dark overcoat carrying a small suitcase.

When the waitresses returned to the restaurant, they only knew from the proprietress that Toki had taken five or six days off to visit her family home, although she was from Akita. Not long after that, Toki and her companion were found dead in an unlikely location.

<b>Double Suicide</b>

On the twenty-first of January, in the early morning, a labourer encountered two bodies on a rocky beach while on his way to a factory in Najoma. The detectives, together with the police doctor and a forensic expert from Fukuoka, arrived at the scene. The rosy cheeks of the pair are caused by potassium cyanide, which they took from the orange juice. 

Toki's companion is Kenichi Sayama, a thirty-one-year-old man who works as Assistant Section Chief in Section X, Ministry X. The police searched his jacket and found some cash and a few other possessions but no suicide note. Due to the recent government bribery scandal, his suicide was linked to the act of covering the bribery for his superior.

Jutora Torigai was one of the veterans of the Fukuoka Police. He finds it hard to believe that it was a suicide. After questioning the staff at the inn, Torigai felt strange that Sayama was staying at the inn alone, waiting for a phone call. When the call arrived on the fifth day, Sayama left immediately and committed suicide with Toki later that evening. Kiichi Mihara, inspector with the Second Investigative Division of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, joined the investigation as  Sayama's section was filled with bribery scandals.

If the pair were planning to commit suicide, it seemed pointless to create witness to their departure. What is the connection between Yasuda and the pair's death? Why did Yasuda plan a four-minute witness? Four minutes is the only gap of time that they can see the pair from their platform without obstructions from any trains.

## Notes
- This is a cautiously crafted story with many meticulous details, essentially tracing back to the train schedule on the crime day. According to the author, all train and plane times mentioned in the book are based on the timetable of 1957, the year the crime took place.
- I couldn't find any loopholes or unanswered questions in the case.
This is one of the most meticulously planned crime stories I'd ever read.
