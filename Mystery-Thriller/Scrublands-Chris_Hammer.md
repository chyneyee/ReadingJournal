- Byron Swift, the priest killed five innocent people in the church.
- The first local that Martin met is Mandalay Blonde or Mandy. She claims that Byron is a good priest. She doesn't believe that the priest abused children. She even shares her past with Martin and how the priest helps and cares for her. All the praises for the priest didn't convince Martin's view about the priest who had committed a mass murder.
- The local policeman, Robbie tells Martin to look for Codger Harris who lives in the Scrublands if he wants to know more about the priest.
- Codger tells Martin that the priest smoked weeds, killed small animals and enjoyed solitude at Scrublands but the priest is a kind man.
- According to Robbie, before he shot the priest, the priest mentioned that Harley Snouch knows everything.
- Sergeant Herb Walker claims that Byron was a man without a past and protected by powerful and influential people. Byron was using someone else's identity. The death record of the real Byron Swift has been expunged. He believed Byron was a former soldier, a tattoo indicated he'd been in Afghanistan, Special Forces SAS. They wanted to exhume the body for DNA but their investigation has been ruled out of bounds. He received an anonymous phone call two days before the shooting. A boy claimed that Reverend Swift had sexually abused him and another boy. Byron was released after an order came from Sydney. 
- Two bodies were found in the farm dam at Harley's place. Believed to be German hitchhikers. They died five days before the shooting.

## Personal Thoughts
- The buildup of the mystery and how the writer leads the reader to seek the truth are unquestionably brilliant at the beginning. However, the story was told at a slow pace, and it's getting complicated towards the end. The story was draggy, and messy and lost its interest when the writer kept adding more plot twists and side stories.
