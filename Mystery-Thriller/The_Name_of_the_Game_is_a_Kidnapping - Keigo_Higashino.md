# The Name of the Game is a Kidnapping - Keigo Higashino

## Storyline
Sakuma reaches his office, Cyberplan, and is informed by the president that the automobile park plan has been cancelled. The Nissei Automobile contacted them for a novel idea to promote their new car.

The newly appointed executive vice president, Mr Katsuragi rejected the plan and proposed rethinking everything from the beginning. He wants a new idea that highlights Nissei's highest priority is environmental protection. He also wants Cyberplan to replace the entire team especially the leader, Sakuma. 

Sakuma is extremely upset with the decision and in rage against Mr Katsuragi. He wants to confront Mr Katsuragi for more clarification about his criticism towards him. He goes to the Nissei Automobile's chairman's mansion and sees a girl jump out to the street from the top of the mansion's iron railing. He follows the girl all the way to a hotel. The girl fails to get a room after trying a couple of hotels. He continues tailing her and introduces himself, telling her that it's hard for a lone woman to get a room without reservation. 

The girl introduces herself as Juri, the daughter of Mr Katsuragi. Juri tells him that she is running away from home and reveals that she is the daughter of her father's lover from his earlier marriage. Her father divorced once and married his current wife for twenty years. Her mother died when she was three and she has been living with the Katsuragis since eight. She couldn't blend in with the family and she hates her half-sister.

Juri doesn't want to go home but she needs money. She suggests Sakuma get the money from her father even if he has to act as a kidnapper who kidnaps her for a ransom. At first, Sakuma thought it was a crazy idea. However, after another humiliation by Mr Katsuragi, he decides to play a kidnapping game with Mr Katsuragi. Sakuma and Juri ask for three hundred million yen in cash for the ransom. They will exchange messages with Mr Katsuragi via a bulletin board.

<summary>The Ending</summary>

  - They successfully got the ransom money. Sakuma takes thirty million and the rest leaves to Juri. He drops Juri near Shinagawa station and part ways. After a few days, from the bulletin board, he realised that Juri hadn't returned home.
- The missing of Juri appears on the news. Sakuma is getting concerned because the police begin their investigation. The worst thing is the news on the TV screen shows a photo with a different face of Juri Katsuragi.
- Sakuma goes around the school and asks about Juri's sister, Chiharu. When one of the classmates showed him the photo of Chiharu, it was the girl who had participated in the kidnapping game with him.
- After another ten days, the police found Juri's body in Yokosuka. 
- Chiharu appears in Sakuma's house and reveals the truth. She killed Juri accidentally and ran away from home. She was expecting her parents to clean up the mess and she will go home after that. Her father has been keeping in touch with Chiharu during the staged kidnapping. She has been instructed by her father all this time while following Sakuma's plan to cover up the murder.

## Personal Thoughts
I don't know whether I should despise or pity Sakuma based on his perception of human beings and life. He's a narrow-minded and self-centred person and views everyone live with their masks and this world is a game. Or probably he's an insecure person because he feels exposing his true face will lead to failure. Overall, I think this is a pathetic character. His egoism and self-confidence are too strong and can't accept something different from his expectations.

In short, Sakuma is angry that his idea is rejected by Mr Katsuragi. He coincidentally witnessed the daughter of his important client running away from home. He uses the opportunity to turn it into a kidnapping game to prove that he is smarter than Mr Katsuragi.

I felt confused most of the time when reading this book. I'm not sure whether it's the translation or I'm not up to the writer's expected interpretations. The entire plan seemed complicated and meticulous but also messed up my understanding. There aren't any various tones throughout the story because the focus is the brilliance of the kidnapping game.
