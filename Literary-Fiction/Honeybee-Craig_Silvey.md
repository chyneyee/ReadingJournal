## Personal Thoughts 
- I already sensed the gloominess of this story from the first chapter.
- A book that makes you have a lot to ponder and reflect on your life.
- Both helping each other to cope with their lonely life. An unusual friendship shared by emptiness and directionlessness of life.
- A journey of self-acceptance and the importance of finding support. It's also about self-discovery and forgiveness. Sam wants to do something for people whom he likes, but he messes up several times. Despite that, his friends forgive him and encourage him not to give up his life and to be brave to become his true self.
- A powerful and moving narration based on Sam's account, who has a troubled relationship with his mother and strikes an unusual friendship with an older man, which leads him to finally earn his own identity and self-acceptance.
