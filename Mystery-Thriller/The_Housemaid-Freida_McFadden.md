# The Housemaid (The Housemaid #1) - Freida McFadden

## Summary
### Part 1 - Three Months Earlier
- The narrator's name is Millie. She is in an interview for the housemaid position in Nina Winchester's house. The job requires Millie to live with Nina's family. Millie is introduced with a small room which has a dark stairway leading to it. Despite the uneasiness with the room and Nina's daughter Cecelia, Millie wishes she will get the job. It's better than living in her old car. However, she has no confidence that she will get hired if Nina does a background check on her.
- Millie is shocked that Nina offers her the job, wondering whether Nina did a background check, as she later reveals that she was in prison for ten years.
- Millie lives in a tiny room with a small window. The door's lock is outside. The Italian landscaper who works at Winchester's house is warning her about the danger, but Millie has no idea what it is all about.
- Nina seems to have multiple personalities. She often accuses Millie of not doing something that she never asks. At the same time, Cecilia is being unreasonable with her demands and seems creepy to Millie. Millie feels uncomfortable with the entire family except Andrew, but Millie has to bear with them to keep her job.
- Millie finds an antipsychotic medication that belongs to Nina in the medicine cabinet. Later, she heard Nina's friends mentioning that Nina was in a mental institution before. She also finds out that Nina tried to kill Cecilia when Cecilia was a baby.
- Nina suddenly drops the bombshell about Millie's past, indicating that she knew about Millie's background. She knew that Millie went to the Broadway show with Andrew when she wasn't around. Since then, Nina tries to make Millie's life harder than before.
- Andrew and Nina have an argument, and he decides to separate from her. He asks her to leave the house immediately.
- Millie thought that she would have the entire house or a better room, but before she could enjoy the luxury, she was stuck in her tiny room with the door locked.

## Personal Thoughts
- Maybe it has been quite some time since I've read such a mystery or thriller book; I couldn't stand when the story kept mentioning Millie's fantasy over Andrew.
- I couldn't bear with how many times the writer mentioned how handsome Andrew is. And even though Millie is in an argument with Nina, the writer still needs to remind the readers how handsome Andrew is when he suddenly appears at that time.
- I felt the story was thrilling enough until Millie began a relationship, which cheapened the storyline. Then all those sexual fantasies make it even worse. The same for Nina. The story was quite good until another sexual relationship occurred. Why does everyone have to sleep with someone in the story? 
- Cringe. Overrated. Lack of vocabulary and repetitiveness. I found this book appears on the list "Dymocks Top 101". I had stopped looking for books to read from the Dymocks list for so many years. I thought to give it a try, and I really regret it. This book made me feel like I was reading the writer's fantasy romance diary, which she wrote during her high school years.
- The characters are one-dimensional. I don't see the difference between Millie and Nina, as both were written in an almost similar manner.
- Overall, the mystery and thriller parts are alright. The story about Millie and Nina at the beginning was usually enjoyable to read, although the writing style seems lacking in vocabulary. Unfortunately, when the writer tries to get the romance and sexual fantasies incorporated into the story, it becomes invasive and spoils all the good parts.
