## Summary
- A wedding held on an island. The guests are trapped between the darkness inside the marquee and the raging storm outside. When the lights come back, they hear a terrifying scream.Â 
- The story begins with the wedding day and later transitions to what happens the day before the wedding based on various accounts, from the wedding planner to the bride. Then, the narration continues switching between these two timelines, the day before and the wedding day itself.
- Jules received a note a few weeks ago, warning her not to marry Will. It gets to her, but she continues to proceed with the wedding.
- After a number of accounts from different characters, the story briefly returns to the wedding night, continuing from the scream. It's from a waitress who witnessed a dead body from the outside.
- Then, the story slowly reveals almost every key character's dark secrets. The bride, who is obsessed with seeking her parents's love, is indecisive about whether to go ahead with the wedding due to a note; the best man did all the dirty work for the groom during their school days but later finds out about a betrayal; something bad happened to Charlie at the stag party, and Hannah keeps trying to find evidence of any affair between Charlie and the bride while she is fangirling the bridegroom; the bridesmaid with unfortunate relationships in the past; and a mysterious murder occurred during high school, which relates to the groom with the secret he shares with the best man.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

- Will lied to his best friend Johno that the show producer rejected Johno to appear in a survival show. Actually, the producer wanted both of them. Johno didn't know there was a meeting, and Will told the producer that Johno isn't interested in the show.
- Olivia had a relationship with Will after she broke up with her boyfriend. She also had an abortion after that. When they met for the first time at Jules's engagement, Will acted as if they had never met before.
- Will and Johno kidnapped a schoolmate and tied him at the bottom of the cliff path. The schoolmate found out about the stolen exam papers when he was cleaning their room. The schoolmate later died because he couldn't get himself free before the tide came.
- Hannah has a sister who committed suicide seventeen years ago. Her sister ended a relationship with a guy so she can focus on her studies. The guy didn't take it well and had revenge porn on her. From the conversation with some of the guests at the wedding, she finds out that the guy is Will.
- Will's body was found by his friends at the bog when they went out looking for something after the waitress came back to the marquee with a scream.
- Aoife's brother is the kid who was killed by Will and Johno. Aoife stabs Will, but Johno is accused as the killer because he is holding the knife when the friends discover Will's body at the bog.

## Personal Thoughts
- A bunch of immature friends, an irritating bride, a "fake nice" bridegroom, and most of the people in the wedding are judgemental against each other. I guess it's a good idea that we get to know the inner thoughts of the characters. Actually, almost everyone is suspicious and mostly has strange kinds of behaviours and relationships.
- A lot of drinking and privileged people, and the continuous mentioning public school. I thought private schools were more privileged. Then, I did some research. So, public schools in the UK are posh schools that have high tuition fees and are also boarding schools. Public schools mean private schools due to the private tuition fees. Confusing.
- The thrill and mystery keep going until the end. What I don't like about the story is the pace is too slow, and the switching timelines make it hard to keep up with the story.
