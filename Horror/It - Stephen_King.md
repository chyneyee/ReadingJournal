## Personal Thoughts
- I consider it complex and difficult to read because of its length, the alternating timelines (the past and present), the numerous characters, and the intricate history of the town.
- Pennywise disguises itself in various forms which reflects the deepest fears of its victims.
- Certain parts of the story are quite interesting, while others feel overly lengthy and sluggish.
- The in-depth layers of stories to discover as the story progresses are what make the story multidimensional.
- Although the story is unique and interesting, the process of reading it is torturous.
- The story focuses on friendship and loyalty as its main themes. Henry and his gang are the driving force behind such a meaningful friendship, and Pennywise is the ultimate test of their loyalty.
