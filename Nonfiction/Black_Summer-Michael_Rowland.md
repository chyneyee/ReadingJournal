# Black Summer: Stories of Loss, Courage and Community from the 2019-2020 Bushfires - Michael Rowland

## Summary
Australia's 2019 - 20 Black Summer fires burnt an estimated 18 million hectares. Thirty-three people died, and over 5900 buildings were destroyed, including 3000 homes. At least one billion animals were killed, and some endangered species may have been driven to extinction.

During the Black Summer, the ABC worked around the clock to ensure the vital information was accessible to people in danger from the fires. The lives of the reporters were at risk, and there were concerns for their safety and mental well-being. 

This book details how ABC's metro newsrooms and local radio stations were working tirelessly to keep the nation up to date with the unfolding disaster and the commitment and professionalism of the front liners with their emergency broadcasting. There are accounts of people's fears during and after the fires and stories of kindness and optimism in such dark times.

The stories were grouped into a few sections. The first section is "Unprecedented", which describes the unexpected swiftness of the fire and the responses of the front liners and the affected ones. It follows with the "Disaster" when the catastrophe occurred in most remote areas. Then, the following section included the stories some victims shared about their evacuation experiences. Besides the affected locals, there were stories of some people who played an important role and worked tirelessly against the fire and protect the community. The "Community and Resilience" describes the kindness and the strength of the community's unity to rebuild together. Lastly, we begin to reflect on the future after such an unforgettable disaster and the awareness of the impacts of climate change.

The bushfire victims might be forced to move on with their lives, but the devastating memories will linger, and the trauma will be heightened every summer since then. The generosity and the kindness of strangers in the darkest period show that humanity hasn't lost its way.
