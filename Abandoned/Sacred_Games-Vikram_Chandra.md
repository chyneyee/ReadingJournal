## Personal Opinion
According to Goodreads, the last time I abandoned a book after reading halfway through was in 2020. It was a biography book about an air stewardess and her experience on the plane. I dumped the book at a very early stage because the writer was rambling about gossip and criticism among other women colleagues and her sex life. I never feel bad at all for abandoning that book.

This book is way different from the other book. At least the writer has put a lot of effort into coming out with a decent story and a writer who really wants to write out his story. I am slightly guilty of abandoning this book because I hate incompletion, and writing an opinion about why I left a book halfway through is tougher than I thought.

The first thing I wanted to point out is the excessive untranslated words in the book made it hard to follow the story.

Then, the introduction didn't clearly indicate the storyline's direction and the mixture of local slang and languages made it even harder to read. Occasionally I lost where the character was supposed to be and what was happening. I reread some passages more than once, and I feel very bumpy with the flow of the story.

The story begins with a white Pomeranian named Fluffy being thrown out of the window, leading Sartaj and Kartekar to investigate a domestic violence case involving an air hostess and her husband. It seems interesting to continue reading to discover the reason behind the violence or any sinister behind this couple leading to it. It was a short introduction with no further updates, and it moved on to Sartaj's life as a police officer and his other colleagues. 

Alright, maybe that is not the main plot. Let's move on to the next story. 

In the poorest part of Navnagar, a young Bangladeshi boy with good clothes is found dead after falling across a doorway in a house belonging to Ahsan Naeem. According to his father, Shamsul Shah was killed by two choppers who were Shamsul's friends - Bazil Chaudhary and Faraj Ali. They had a drink before leading to a fight and murder. Murder case involving Bangladeshis was unusual because they usually tried to make a living and avoid attention. 

I thought that would be the main plot, as it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the story moves to the next case. Sartaj gets an anonymous tip-off about the secret hideout of the legendary boss of G-Company, Ganesh Gaitonde. Sartaj tries to talk Ganesh out of leaving his house and follows him to the police station.

I stopped reading after only completing 6% of the book. I'm unsure whether I lost my interest or I'm frustrated that I don't know what is going on, as if something is wrong with my understanding ability. At this stage, the story seems to go back to Ganesh, narrating his life, and another character Paritosh Shah is introduced. I have no idea who he is, even though I tried to go back several pages to find out who this new character is. I don't understand why Sartaj's life suddenly jumps to Ganesh narrating his life before his confrontation with the police.

It's time to give up. I have to let go. It's pointless to continue if I keep reading in a lost state.
