# Elevation - Stephen King

## Storyline
The problem with Scott is his unreasonable weight loss. His weight stays the same whether he is naked or in clothes with full quarters. Although his weight is falling, his physical dimensions remain the same no matter how much he eats.

At the same time, Scott has a minor issue with his neighbour, a lesbian couple. It has nothing to do with their gender or unconventional marriage, but the problem begins with their dogs pooping at the back of Scott's lawn. Scott tries his best to be on good terms with the couple, but one of them strongly resents him because of the town residents and their poor restaurant business. The bad business is caused by their marriage in a conservative town, and the neighbour feels Scott is just among the townfolks who have prejudiced against them.

Scott lives positively with his current strange condition, but despite that, he is counting down the days until his weight reaches zero.

## Personal Thoughts

There should be more short stories like this. It's enjoyable to read, and you can move on to the next book after finishing it. It's a feel-good story for me despite its sad ending. I was wondering what the best ending for this story would be. Somehow, I really liked the ending, and I can't think of any other alternative ending more beautiful than that.
