# Snow Angels (Inspector Kari Vaara #1) - James Thompson

## Summary
he background is set in Lapland, the northernmost part of Finland during the Kaamos period. Kaamos means the dark time until spring which begins before Christmas. In a snowfield on Aslak Haltta's reindeer farm, the police discover the dead body of Sufia Elmi, a Somalian movie star.

Per capita, the murder rate in Finland is about the same as in most American big cities. In a country that is sensitive about race relations, Sufia Elmi's murder will become a major headline. 

Sufia's body is found in a naked state and her neck has a ligature mark which is probably caused by silk or similar synthetic material. She seems dragged from the vehicle because the snow is disturbed between the body and the tyre tracks. She is mutilated and her face is brutalised. Her stomach is carved with racial slurs. 

Inspector Kari Vaara will lead the investigation but it would be a tough case for him. It's near Christmas and some officers are on vacation. It's an ideal time to commit a murder and a local would know this. 

The murder investigation leads to a rich man from Helsinki. Kari's ex-wife left Kari for Seppo thirteen years ago. Seppo's card number was used for Sufia's payment for the rental of her vacation cottage. He also owns the same car model that the police are looking for which is based on a witness.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

- The suspect shifts to a rich man's son who is registered as a sex offender. He admits that he had sex with Sufia several times and even paid her for it.
- Kari's best friend's son Heikki committed suicide and left a suicide note mentioning that someone forced him to do it. This requires an investigation into whether Heikki was involved in Sufia's murder.
- The teardrop on Sufia belongs to Heikki's DNA, which means he was present at the murder scene.
- Heli is dead. Someone set her on fire.
- Valtteri confessed to Kari that he killed Heli. After Heli and Heikki killed Sufia, Heikki told his father everything. Heli seduced Heikki and made him kill Sufia. She uses religion to convince Heikki that Sufia is a sinner and he's doing what God wants him to do. Valterri killed Heli because of his son's suicide. Valtteri shoots himself after he reveals the truth to Kari.

## Personal Thoughts
I know I should understand Kate's difficulty in adapting to the culture and also the language barrier but her views about Finland seem ironic coming from an American citizen. The arguments are not strong enough to push someone to move away from his country especially to move to America. I admit I'm a bit annoyed every time Americans think the United States is the best in the world and like to compare with it wherever they go. Meanwhile, Kari takes almost everything to his own fault and blames himself for every death. 

It leaves you with a subtle sadness after knowing the truth in the end. Usually, a crime novel ends with the truth and there's nothing to look back on but this story makes you feel sad. The investigation keeps going in circles and then, the truth suddenly comes out of nowhere.
