## Summary

### Museum Owner Murder Case
#### File 30 - [The Armoured Knight](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_4#File_030_-_The_Armored_Knight)
Conan, Kogoro and Ran visit the museum and accidentally discover the brutal death of the new owner of the museum, Manaka. Inspector Megure arrives to investigate. He, Kogoro, and Conan check the surveillance cameras and find the murderer is disguised as a knight's suit of armour.

#### File 31 - [Dying Message](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_4#File_031_-_Dying_Message)
From the surveillance camera, Conan notices that Manaka tried to write something on a piece of paper between the first attack and his death. He threw the pen away, and the paper remained crumpled in his hand. The paper reveals Kubota as the killer. Kubota has no alibi; as the museum curator, Ochiai had him working alone on a task in the office. Iijima believes Kubota is the killer because the owner wanted him to repay the money he had made from secretly selling pieces from the museum.

#### File 32 - [The Pen that Cannot Write](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Volume_4#File_032_-_The_Pen_That_Cannot_Write)
Based on the evidence, Conan discovers that the murderer is an art lover, and Kubota is totally opposite to that. The killer has changed the inkless pen, and Manaka does not write the dying message.

Kogoro, Ran and Conan are on the train to Kyoto for a wedding. While Conan tries to avoid more questions from Kogoro about his parents, he bumps into Gin and Vodka. 

Conan attempts to hide a gum-wrapped mic bug under the seat of one of the men, but Ran catches him and throws the mic into the ashtray of the same seat. When the men in black return, Conan eavesdrops via the glasses and learns their code names: Gin and Vodka. They exchanged a black briefcase with information about gold for 400 million yen. Gin also reveals to Vodka that there is actually a bomb inside the briefcase, which the buyer will accidentally set off at 3:10 PM and blow up the entire train.
