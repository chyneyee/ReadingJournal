# The Polygamist's Daughter: A Memoir - Anna LeBaron

## Storyline
Anna started her story when her parents were on the run from federal authorities, and she was abandoned in Mexico for a year. She was auditioning as a potential wife for Rafael. Her father, the notorious Ervil LeBaron, had promised Rafael several of his daughters in marriage. Anna and her sisters were pawns to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, her father's followers.

Ervil LeBaron was the leader of The Church of the Lamb of God, a radical offshoot of the Mormon Church. Anna's mother, Anna Mae, was the fourth of his thirteen wives. Anna and her siblings were taken care of by their eldest sister, who was just thirteen years old, and they lived with their mother's sister-wives and other children.

Besides the countless siblings and numerous sister-wives, the continuously growing family tends to move a lot and usually lives in a crowded environment in a shabby or dilapidated house. Anna shares some of her memories growing up in a cult family as one of the children of a notorious polygamy cult leader. For most of her childhood, she lived in confusion and seemed invisible to her parents, who were busy running from authorities and preaching their beliefs. 

When Anna finally felt that she had a normal life, her mother decided to return to Denver, where they used to live more traditionally. Anna despised working as a cheap labour under Ervil's right-hand man, Dan Jordan. She didn't want to move back to Denver, leading her to walk out of the house and leave her family.

## Personal Thoughts
It's sad when a small kid continuously moves from one place to another without her parents' care. The fortunate part was Anna was an optimistic person. She tried to see the good part of her life instead of lingering with the indescribable poverty or her peers who had a more normal life.
