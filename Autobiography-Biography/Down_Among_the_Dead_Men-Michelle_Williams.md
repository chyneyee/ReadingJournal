# Down Among the Dead Men: A Year in the Life of a Mortuary Technician - Michelle Williams


After working in the NHS for over a decade as a healthcare assistant for people with learning disabilities, Michelle started to look for a different job for a change. A vacancy for a trainee Medical Technical Officer at a local Gloucestershire Hospital caught her attention. She never expected the informal interview would require witnessing a real postmortem on a dead person, and the atmosphere in the mortuary was surprisingly relaxing. A few days later, she received an invitation to a formal interview and a written confirmation the following day.

Michelle shared her experience working as a trainee MTO at the mortuary in Gloucestershire Hospital, most of the time working with Clive and Graham. She even shares some interesting cases, including one elderly woman who died under the negligence of care by the aged care home. The woman had dementia, and they found a napkin stuffed on her throat; she probably ate everything on her plate when no carer was around then. 

Interestingly, she brought up unusual cases, such as dealing with a body weighing 560 pounds. I think most readers would be curious to know how the gurney supports such weight and whether the body can be fitted into the fridge in the mortuary.

The rest of the book is mostly about the daily life in the office with her colleagues. Some people were nice, but some pathologists were sexist or overconfident. Occasionally, she would include her personal life, but I felt it was irrelevant and nothing spectacular about it. Even though the lives in the office were a bit hard to be written in a livelier way, it was still better than her personal life.

As I continued reading, I felt the writer might not have enough content to make it into a book. In a harsher way, this book shouldn't exist at all. The work-related stories were alright but it was just a lack of content, and the writer had to include her personal life, which made it even worse. It's not easy to write about life working in mortuary, but it's even harder when you don't accumulate enough content and no support with a vigorous writing style.

Towards the end of the story, I felt irritated by the writer's thought of avoiding work on Christmas Day. If someone takes a certain kind of job, they must be willing to be prepared to work during the holidays. She was singing praises of Maddie for being her good friend and caring for her dogs. I found it revolting when she tried to talk her way out by planting a seed into Clive, telling him that she used to do on-call when she was still new in the job, indicating Maddie should too. Then, the writer was so happy and relieved when Maddie offered to be on-call on Christmas so she didn't have to stay sober that day. I feel bad for judging someone, but at the same time, it's tough not to get annoyed with such a person. The worse is it's just an on-call, not asking her to wait for work in the mortuary, and later, she dared to mention that she thought of turning off her phone. Seriously? What kind of work ethic is that? Probably I'm still angry with her half-hearted responsibility, it made me more furious when she said she felt odd that not everyone celebrates Christmas. It's because Maddie hates Christmas, which led her to take the on-call work. The existence of Maddie in the team made me realise that the writer rarely discussed her mistakes in her job. She often highlighted Maddie's mistakes and weaknesses because Maddie was still new in the team and followed up with how she handled the situation calmly and naturally. If I were Maddie, I would try to stay a distance with her after reading this book.

The last few chapters talked more about her personal life, especially how she dealt with her grandfather's illness. I really couldn't take it anymore. Why do the readers need to know what colour she had chosen for the lining of the coffin for her grandfather? Why do we need to know how her family spent their time taking care of her grandfather? Why do we need to know why her mother has to make sure that her grandfather had his underwear on when he was in the coffin? I wanted to scream out loud why I have go through all this to finish this book.

At the end of the book, I'm really surprised that she mentioned that she loves the job. Maybe she really did, but she didn't give me the impression she was. Passion comes together with responsibilities and commitments. Understandably, there are occasional complaints and bad days, but most of the time, I felt she wanted to go home as soon as she finished her work, tried to avoid working on holidays and extra hours, was reluctant to take the exam, and had other complaints. Perhaps I'm being hard in hoping her to be as passionate as Clive, but I don't feel she loves her work like she claimed to be. It was more like she treated it like a normal job.

I am really annoyed that the next sentence is continuing without a space after the full stop.
