# The Brothers Karamazov - Fyodor Dostoevsky (Translated by Constance Garnett)

## Summary
### Part I
* Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov was a well-known landowner who had a tragic death thirteen years ago. He was married twice and had three sons. The eldest, Dmitri, by his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor’s first wife came from a rich and noble family who was also a landowner. The marriage didn’t go well, and she ran away with another man, leaving her three-year-old child with Fyodor. Fyodor sank into debauchery and forgot the existence of Dmitri. Grigory, the faithful servant of the family, took great care of Dmitri or Mitya. Mitya has been changing homes several times later on.
* Mitya has an irregular boyhood and wild life. He was convinced that Fyodor was wealthy with his wife’s inheritance money. When Mitya returned years later to settle his affairs, he was shocked that Fyodor had no inheritance left and might even be in debt to his father for the sums already received. Mitya suspected deceit and cheating, which led to a violent confrontation.
* Fyodor married his second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, but the marriage lasted for eight years. Sofya was only sixteen and lived in another province with her tyranny benefactress. Fyodor was captured by her innocent beauty, comparing his first marriage, which he married for money. Fyodor takes advantage of Sofya’s guilt and meekness by having women in the house. Sofya ends up with mental illness and later dies. Their two sons, Ivan and Alexey, have also been forgotten by their father after the mother’s death. The general’s widow, Sofya’s adopted mother, took the children away from Fyodor. She died after that but left some inheritance money to the children. Then, a principal takes care of the children as his own but later dies when Ivan enters university. Ivan got some journalism work and earned his reputation in literacy circle.
* Ivan came to visit his Fyodor and lived with him for two months. The visit is rather mysterious as he is never interested in Fyodor and neither requires money from Fyodor which has nothing to give him. The youngest, Alexey, also lives in the town for a year in a monastery. Alexey has been likeable by everyone since he was a child. He decided to enter the monastery after visited his mother’s grave.
* Zosima, an elder monk, arranges a meeting for Dmitri and his father to settle the dispute between them regarding the inheritance money.
* Another reason for Dmitri or Mitya being in a tense relationship with his father is because both are interested in the same woman, Grushenka. Mitya abandoned his wealthy fiancée, Katerina Ivanovna, for Grushenka and felt Ivan was more worthy for Katerina.
* Lizavetta is a mentally challenged, homeless twelve-year-old girl who got into Fyodor’s house and gave birth to an infant but died later. Grigory, Fyodor’s servant, and his wife, Marfa, took care of the infant and named the infant as Pavel. Fyodor invented a surname for him, Smerdyakov, after his mother’s nickname. There was a rumour that Smerdyakov’s biological father was Fyodor, although Fyodor denied it. Smerdyakov became Fyodor’s second servant and employed as a cook.
* Dmitri’s colonel has two daughters. He befriended the first daughter, Agafya Ivanovna. The second daughter, Katerina Ivanovna, is a noble and beautiful woman. Dmitri went to her once, but she barely looked at him. He vowed to get revenge for this. When he heard that the colonel had stolen some money from the government, he confronted Agafya and promised to keep it as a secret and offers the money if she sends Katerina to him. While Dmitri was preparing to go out, Katerina appeared at his door. He thought the sexual favour would probably lead to rejection if he appeared at her house for the marriage proposal. He got angry and humiliated her. However, in the end, he changed his mind and gave her the money and bowed deeply to her. She was surprised and returned the gesture with true humility.
* After three months, Katerina wrote him a letter from Moscow. She returned his money and wanted to marry him. Dmitri didn’t love her and sends Ivan on behalf of him, who he thinks is more suitable for Katerina. Dmitri wanted Alexei to tell Katerina that he was a sensualist and had already spent the money that she entrusted him to send to Agafya. Alexei suggests that he and Ivan could get three thousand for Dmitri, but Dmitri is unconvinced. Dmitri wanted Alexei to ask for the money from Fyodor, although they knew their father wouldn't give him the money. From Smerdyakov, Dmitri knew that Fyodor had withdrawn three thousand roubles for Grushenka and asked her to go to Fyodor. Smerdyakov will inform Dmitri if Grushenka goes to Fyodor. Currently, Fyodor is drinking with Ivan, which makes this a good time for Alexei to ask him for money. Dmitri is convinced that Grushenka will not show up on that day and if she does, Dmitri will try to stop it or consider killing Fyodor.
* Katerina thought that Grushenka promised to leave Dmitri alone when her former lover was back. Grushenka humiliated Katerina and admits that she is playing with Dmitri’s love and never promised her anything. She also knew Katerina offered herself to Dmitri, before which Katerina called Dmitri a scoundrel.

### Part II
* The tension escalated between Fyodor and Dmitri after Dmitri beat his father, claiming that he saw Grushenka go to the house.
* Fyodor suspects Ivan is living in the house because he wants to win Katerina’s heart and also wants to know how much money Fyodor gives to Grushenka. He suspects Ivan doesn’t want Fyodor to get married, so Ivan can have Fyodor’s money, although Fyodor is not going to leave any money to his children after he dies.
* Katerina loves Ivan, but she persuades herself to love Dmitri because she is committed to save him.
* Ivan has a strong dislike of Smerdyakov. It irritates him when Smerdyakov is always excited about the family’s scandal. What angers him most is the bond between Smerdyakov and Fyodor.
* Ivan changed his mind and returned to Moscow instead of running an errand for his father. Meanwhile, Fyodor is so sure that Grushenka will come to the house, but he is also fearful of Dmitri’s appearance too.

### Part III
* The elder Zozima’s death forces Alexei to reenter the world to face the complexities of his family life.
* Grushenka is on her way to Mokroye to see the Polish officer, her former lover who is a widower. For two days, Dmitri is sure that his father will propose to Grushenka, and she is difficult to choose between two of them. Dmitri had forgotten the existence of the Polish officer although Grushenka has shown to him before the letters from the Polish officer.
* Dmitri went to Fyodor’s house to check whether Grushenka was there. Grigory saw a figure and tried to catch the intruder. He recognises the man is Dmitri but is later struck by Dmitri’s pestle. 
* Dmitri later finds out from Grushenka’s servant that Grushenka has left for her former lover. He begins dejected and pawns back his pistol. He takes his pistol and champagnes and travels to Mokroye.
* Dmitri is charged with the murder of his father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>

* Smerdyakov manipulates Ivan’s guilt by wishing for his father’s death and makes Ivan think that he hinted to Smerdyakov to kill Fyodor.
* Ivan has a brain infection. Smerdyakov hanged himself. His suicide ensures that Ivan will never get the confession out of him. Ivan is succumbing further into illness and Dmitri is imprisoned.
* Dmitri is found guilty of murder by the juries, who consist of peasants.

## Personal Thoughts
* Complicated and full of drama, which rarely exists in modern literature. 
* It’s challenging to read because there are many religious, philosophical, and moral discussions in the story.
* Maybe Katerina’s obsession with Dmitri is because Dmitri didn’t give her special treatment like others who have more respect for her nobility. Katerina has a single-sided thinking that Dmitri needs to be saved, which probably makes her feel worthy in her life. Dmitri doesn’t feel he needs to change, especially for someone whom he never loved and probably feels inferior in front of her.
* The murder only comes in the very later part. The book has more philosophical and religious debates than the story itself.
* This is the second book I’ve read by this author. Most of the male characters are in poverty but extremely wealthy in pride. The women surrounding the men always wanted to help and force the men to accept their aid, but the men were always very proud. Despite their rejections due to pride, they accept the assistance in the end. Most of the characters are loyal to the ones that don’t love them back.
* The resentment between the sons (except Alexei) and their father has been deeply rooted in them due to Fyodor’s selfishness and greed. It's probably a matter of time for Fyodor’s murder. It's a test for those who hate him and the hatred to be tested to the extent of committing the murder. The dissatisfaction among the brothers (except Alexei) also creates distrust among them.
