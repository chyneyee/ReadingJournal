# The Silent Sister (Riley MacPherson #1) - Diane Chamberlain

## Storyline
Riley stays in New Bern for a few weeks to handle her father's will and also clean up her family's house before putting it for sale. She has a tense relationship with her brother Danny, but she hopes to help him recover his mental health. Danny served in Iraq before and returned with PTSD and a broken leg. He lives in a trailer at his father's RV park, deep in the woods and isolated from the outside world.

Tom and his wife Verniece live in the RV park that belongs to Frank MacPherson. Tom was Frank's subordinate when they were U.S. Marshals. When Riley visits Tom and his wife regarding her father's old RV, Verniece reveals to Riley that she is adopted. Riley finds it hard to believe but decides to ask Tom for more details. Tom warns Riley to stay away from her wife because her wife is upset and she is not in her right mind.

Riley later learns from Jeannie (her mother's best friend and her father's partner before he died) that her sister Lisa didn't commit suicide. In fact, the old newspaper clippings that Jeannie tries to keep away from Riley reported that Lisa was an accused murderer when she was seventeen at that time.

- Lisa is alive and able to escape the trial and prison with the help of her father and Tom. She moved to California and started a new life.
- Verniece asks Riley for the land of the RV park in exchange for information about Lisa's whereabouts. Tom reveals the truth to Riley, but she isn't satisfied with the given information as she hopes Tom will tell her the exact location of Lisa at that time. Riley changes her mind and decides not to give away the RV park to Tom.
- Lisa went away for a short time to give birth to Riley before she returned to her violin. The parents sent Lisa away when she was pregnant and told everyone she was studying with another teacher.
- Steven Davis was Riley's father. He raped Lisa when they were at a music festival in Italy. Steven went to Lisa's house after knowing Riley was his daughter and wanted child custody of Riley. He had sexually abused Lisa since she was a kid. Lisa worried that Steven might harm Riley when she saw Riley was on his lap, leading her to shoot him.

- Riley moves to Seattle and lives nearby with Lisa's family.

## Personal Thoughts
- Slow pace but worth the wait when it comes to the revelation about Lisa. Although I didn't like the pace initially, it gets interesting when different people drop random bombshells on Riley every day. 
- In the beginning, the story is filled with suspense because everyone seems to have secrets or knows something dark about the MacPhersons' past. A woman randomly tells Riley she's adopted, but her husband says she's not in her right mind. Then, another woman tells Riley that her deceased sister, who had committed suicide, was a murderer. Later, another man suddenly tells Riley that her sister didn't commit suicide. Even the newspaper clippings reported no body was found and just presumed dead. So, what's next?
- It's funny that everyone around Frank is not happy with his will because they are short of money or Frank promised to give something to them (according to their version of the story). In contrast, his two children didn't care about the will. 
- I feel everyone is annoying in this story. Everyone seems selfish and motivated by their self-interest.
- Riley has a lot of assumptions about others and seems clingy. She admits she is lonely, but it doesn't mean she can keep forcing people to accompany her. She even thought of writing a letter to Steven's wife to let it go after she knew the wife was still looking for Lisa. Ironically, she can't let go of many less important things than someone who has lost a husband.
- Riley is a confusing character. She wants to quickly settle the sale of the house, but at the same time, she keeps avoiding Jeannie and her daughter. When Jeannie has already set a date (in two weeks) for the estate sale, Riley is unhappy and prefers it to be next month or another two months. So, does it means if she can't find the truth about Lisa for a year, they have to wait for her for a year? She wants their help, but at the same time, she keeps avoiding them, which prolongs the matter further. It's not that I like Jeannie and her daughter because they were also annoying and pushy.
- Riley seems lovely or nice at the beginning. I was shocked when she broke her promise after learning the details about Lisa from Tom. She was angry with Tom's outdated information, but after that, she searched the Internet with the given information. Initially, she wasn't comfortable with Jeannie and Christine, but she needed their help with the house. When she couldn't take it anymore due to the pressure, she angrily shooed them away. I don't like Jeannie and Christine, but Riley's attitude is also making their job harder. It's very unreasonable and selfish. 
- I found it ridiculous that Riley couldn't hire a private investigator by herself, and she contacted Steven's wife for help when her sister killed Steven.
- Initially, the story is filled with mysteries and suspense, but it seems predictable and really irks me when reading about Riley. She keeps saying that she is lonely and has to deal with everything by herself. She is upset that she is alone, but Lisa is surrounded by a happy family. How can Lisa be happy as a fugitive? I don't understand why Riley needs other human beings all the time. It annoys me when reading about how she longed for someone, grabbing anyone to accompany her. And lastly, she is an adult, but the way she is eager for a family or a mother is like a toddler. She is so desperate for a family, even assuming someone she thought was her father and even further considering that his children probably are her half-sister.
- The story is good enough for casual reading or a vacation book.
