# The Plant - Stephen King

## Summary
- The story is told in epistolary format, consisting entirely of letters, memos and correspondence. 
- There are six parts.
- Carlos Detweiller sends a manuscript to Zenith House publishing firm. John, one of the editors in the firm, finds the photos are too horrific and look too real. The firm decides to call the police and reveal Carlos's whereabouts. 
- The police release Carlos after an interrogation. Carlos feels betrayed by John and decides to seek revenge. He sends a small ivy plant to John under the name "Roberta Solrac" and acts as a fan of another author. The mailman decides to keep the plant in the janitorial room, ignoring John's request to get rid of any gifts from Roberta.
- Meanwhile, a veteran soldier escaped from the asylum and targeted another editor who rejected his book.
- Overall, the story is about two crazy men who hold grudges against different Zenith House editors and the supernatural abilities possessed by the ivy plant.

## Personal Thoughts
- I never had any expectations about this story since it was one of King's early works. The story can be difficult to follow because it's jumpy, and the words are unusual.
- The storyline is a bit messy and confusing. I wonder if the story would be more intriguing if King decides to rewrite it.
- The beginning of the story is straightforward, but as it progresses, I'm getting more confused by the various directions and characters. I lost the story halfway, to be honest.
