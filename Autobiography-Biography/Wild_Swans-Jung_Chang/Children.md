- In the autumn of 1958, she attended primary school at age six. At that time, she searched for metal objects for steel production under Mao's order for the Great Leap Forward.
- She was always at the top of the class in weekly exams. Others resented her because of her results and liked being alone.
- She was selected for tennis as an after-school sport.
- As a child, her idea of the West was that it was filled with poverty and misery. The adults use people in the West as an example of a bad capitalist world. She was scared of foreigners and terrified of the crucifixion in the church.

- She read her first article by Mao in 1964 and adored Lei Feng.
***
- In 1965, on her 13th birthday, her present from her father was a volume containing the four philosophical works of Mao.
- Her parents chose English instead of Russian as a foreign language subject to be learned in middle school.
- Her new name, Jung (pronounced as Yung), was an ancient and recondite word for 'martial affairs' which appeared only in classical poetry and a few old phrases. It evoked an image of ancient battles between knights in shining armour, with tasselled spears and neighing steeds.
- Grown into blaming herself for any instincts that went against Mao's instructions.
- She was summoned back to school to join the Red Guard. She participated in the activities but tried hard to avoid militant acts on others. She avoided violent acts and was very confused with the campaign.
- She became a Red Guard on 1 October, National Day.
- She made a pilgrimage to Peking to see Chairman Mao with five other girls from the reception office. It took two days and a night to get there. On 25 November 1966, she caught a glimpse of Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square.
- Returned home in December 1966 with rheumatism due to the cold weather in Peking, without an overcoat, and lack of sufficient blankets.
- She coaxed her father from the edge of the apartment's roof when he was mentally ill.
- Her devotion to Mao began to wane after what happened to her parents.
***
- At the end of 1966, she and her siblings decided they had enough of being Red Guards.
- In December 1966, she went to an aeroplane maintenance factory on the outskirts of Chengdu for a month with Plumpie and Ching-ching. She strolled on country roads together but went home as her parents' situation worsened. As her parents' suffering worsened, she left behind Mao's orders and participation in the Cultural Revolution.
- Wrote her first poem on her 16th birthday, 25 March 1968.
- Under the new team in 1968, the students just sat in classes reciting Mao's articles and reading People's Daily editorials, sang songs of Mao's quotations, or gathered to dance 'loyalty dances', waving Little Red Books.
- Middle-school pupils like her were being exiled to remote rural and mountainous areas to do backbreaking farm labour. She chose her friends from Plumpie's form to form a production team and were sent to Ningnan to be reformed on 27 January 1969.
- She had a severe skin rash when just arrived in Ningnan. Within 3 weeks, she experienced several sores running with pus; her legs were swollen from infections, hit by diarrhoea and vomiting. Twenty-six days after she arrived, the propaganda team man, Dong-an, suggested she return to Chengdu for treatment.
- She returned to Chengdu and later went to Yibin to care for Aunt Jun-ying and Xiao-fang. Then, she returned to Chengdu to care for her unwell grandmother. She was away from Ningnan for over two months.
- She returned to Ningnan with Jin-ming, Nana and Wen to complete the rest of the transfer procedure but fell terribly sick.
- Returned to Chengdu after receiving the news of her grandmother's death.
- She needed to find one nearby relative where the commune would accept them before their state supply of food ran out in January.
- Refused to see Bing and Wen due to her guilt related to her grandmother's passing.
- She found a commune for herself, Nana and her sister. The county called Deyang, not far from Jin-ming's place. Specs had a colleague from the county willing to claim them as his cousins. She lived next to a pigsty with Nana when they first arrived at Deyang but later lived in a two-room cottage built by the production team.
- She wasn't popular in the village because she failed to work as hard as they thought she should. Another reason was she was away most of the time because she had to visit her parents in their camps or look after Aunt Jun-ying in Yibin.
- After a year in Deyang, she entered the medical profession as a 'barefoot doctor' without any training.
***
- Few months before her twentieth birthday, she left Deyang for good. She became a factory worker with the help of her mother and talked to the managers of the machinery factory. She was assigned as an apprentice in the foundry under a woman whom everyone called 'Auntie Wei'. After a month, she was transferred to her choice of job - electrician. She experienced five electric shocks in the first month because she worked without formal training.
- She was attracted to her colleague in the factory, Day, but she heard gossip that Day was unworthy of her. The workers felt she was unique, and Day's father had been a Kuomintang officer and had been in a labour camp which would be a misfortune to be dragged by him. Their friendship faded due to pressure from others to Day. She never fell in love with Day due to subconscious self-censorship.
- During five months in Peking, she read more foreign books and was impressed. The increased availability of information from abroad as part of general liberalisation after the downfall of Lin Biao and Nixon's visit gave a convenient pretext.
- She returned to the factory in September 1972. 
- In 1973, six people in the factory applied for a position in the Foreign Languages Department at Sichuan University. She was chosen by four of the factory's five workshops. Her friend, who was nineteen and in the same workshop as her, forgo her candidacy and voted for her.
- She took the Chinese, maths, and English exams. She got honours in all papers and received the highest mark among all the candidates in Chengdu in English oral.
- On 20 July 1973, an applicant submitted a blank paper and complained that the exam was capitalist restoration. Mme Mao and her cohorts condemned the emphasis on academic standards as a 'bourgeois dictatorship'. The exam was declared void. Now the university entrance was decided solely by 'political behaviour'.
- She was recommended by her factory in writing after a collective appraisal meeting of the electricians' team.
- She forgave her father's choice over principles to help her to gain university entrance.
- In October 1973, she entered the Foreign Language Department of Sichuan University in Chengdu to study English.
- She shared a bedroom with other girls. Her subject was English, but there were no native English speakers to learn it. The textbooks were full of propaganda.
- She borrowed some English language textbooks published before the Cultural Revolution from her lecturers and Jin-ming sent books from his university by post. The books contained extracts from writers like Jane Austen, Dickens, and Oscar Wilde, stories from American and European history.
- In late 1974, she was sent to an army unit with the whole university.
- She was impressed, fascinated and envied the Western culture and freedom. She read many English books in the library as there was a massive amount of English books because Chinese books were mainly targeted to be burnt during the Cultural Revolution. She later realised it was Mao who had been behind the destruction and suffering.
- In July, in the emptiness after her father's death, she set a journey with Jin-ming to the Yangtze for a summer vacation.
- She was sent in October to a port in the south called Zhangjiang to practise English with foreign sailors and stayed in the port for three weeks. She and other students worked in two places or shops frequented by sailors. They returned to Chengdu in December after going to Guilin on the way back from Zhangjiang.
- She went with her mother and Xiao-fang to Chongqing during numerous earthquake alerts in the Chengdu area. They returned to Chengdu at the beginning of September.
***
- In January 1977, she graduated without examinations or degrees, which meant she had to return to the machinery factory, but she was desperate to avoid that.
- In January 1977, helped by her mother's colleague, Mr Hui, the chief manager of the bureau, she became an assistant lecturer in English at Sichuan University. She was sent to the countryside on the outskirts of Chengdu as part of a reeducation programme after a week of the appointment.
- In December 1977, her commune life was ended.
- She was sent to the mountains of northern Sichuan to interview applicants for her department, inspiring her to go to the West to further her studies.
- She went through a written and an oral examination on 18 March for the scholarship for studying in the West. Two lecturers and the deputy Party secretary accompanied her to a train to Xi'an to take the exam.
- At the end of May, an unofficial result indicated that she had distinctions for oral and written exams.
- Scholarship was finally endorsed by the Education Ministry in Peking after her father's name was cleared on 12 June.
- She was the first in her university and probably the first in Sichuan to be allowed to study in the West since 1949.
- On 12 September 1978, she travelled to the West with thirteen other university teachers.
***
- In 1982, she decided to stay in Britain. She made London her home.
- In 1988, her mother visited her in England and told the story of her life and grandmother. She was saddened by their stories and decided to write 'Wild Swans'.
- In the spring of 1989, she travelled around China researching this book. She saw the buildup demonstration from Chengdu to Tiananmen Square.
- She was the first person from Communist China to receive a doctorate from a British university in 1982.
- 'Wild Swans' turned out to be a success. Her mother was visited by many people from various backgrounds and invited to different countries; she was admired by many people and even asked for autographs.
- 'Wild Swans' is not allowed to be published in Mainland China. The regime seems to regard the book as a threat to the Communist Party's power. It shows Mao has criminally misruled the Chinese people rather than being basically a good and great leader.
