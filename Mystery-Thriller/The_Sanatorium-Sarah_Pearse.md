# Storyline
The sanatorium was located in an isolated position, high among the mountains. It was designed in such a manner to keep the tuberculosis patients away from the smog of the towns and cities and keep the rest of the population away from them. The road to the sanatorium involved hairpin bends cutting through a dense forest of firs. There are protests and resentments from people about the rebuilding of the sanatorium into a hotel. 

An unknown figure with a gas mask and dressed in black approached Daniel Lemaitre and pushed him to a different car. Before he can make any connections about it, he feels a sharp pain in the thigh and loses consciousness.

## 2018
In 2018, Le Sommet, a 5-star hotel located on a sunny mountain plateau above Crans-Montana, high in the Swiss Alps, set to open after 8 years of extensive planning and construction. It was transformed from one of the town's oldest sanatoriums used for treating tuberculosis before the arrival of antibiotics.

## January 2020
A month ago, Elin Warner received an invitation from her brother Issac to his engagement party with Laure at Le Sommet. Elin and her partner Will Riley accept the invitation and arrive at the hotel when the weather worsens. Will is impressed with the minimalistic design of the hotel, but Elin feels uncomfortable with the hotel's history and unusual designs. The hotel is decorated with several artefacts from the old sanatorium.

Adele works as a housekeeper in Le Sommet. She is rushing to get home to say goodbye to her son before spending a week with his dad. When Adele is on the way to get a bus, she feels pressure on her leg and sees a gloved hand around her ankle. She tumbles, landing her face first on the snow. Adele tries to run away to hide from her attacker until she faces an unknown figure with a gas mask.

Meanwhile, the storm is building outside the hotel with heavy snow and fury wind. Besides feeling unsettled with the hotel and uncomfortable with her brother and his fiancee, who used to be her good friend, Elin is still struggling with the death of her other family members and the Hayler case. She is on leave from her detective work but must decide when to return to her job.

The story eventually leads to a conversation among Elin, Will, Isaac and Laure about the missing Daniel Lemaitre. Daniel was the principal architect for the hotel but went missing in the final stages of planning. He left the site in the afternoon but didn't make it home, leaving his car in the car park. The hotel was meant to open in 2017 but was delayed by a year due to Daniel's disappearance.

They plan to have dinner with Isaac and Laure on the day they arrive at the hotel. The relationship between Elin and her brother gets worse when Isaac and Laure fail to turn up for dinner. The next day, Isaac tells Elin that Laure has disappeared, and she wonders whether the disappearance relates to what she had seen the night before. On the same day, a guest finds the remaining bones of Daniel Lemaitre in the forest behind the hotel.

  <summary>The Ending</summary>
  
- While hiking behind the hotel, Jeremiah Bisset found a corpse with remaining bones buried under the snow. He found an expensive watch which indicates it is the missing architect Daniel Lemaitre.
- Adele is kidnapped by a stranger with a gas mask. She is injected with a sedative, and when she wakes up, she realises she is being blindfolded, gagged, and bound in ropes with her back propped against a wall. She discovers she's in a mask with a C-tube attached after they remove the blindfold.
- Laure has another mobile phone, and there was a number that she kept calling. She did it without Isaac knowing it. Isaac found some of Lucas's photos in Laure's bag.
- Hotel evacuation on the third day due to the high risk of avalanches. Before they leave with the last bus, a hotel staff Axel finds Adele's lifeless body in a pool. According to Axel, he heard a heated argument between Adele and Laure a week before. Elin finds several encrypted files in Laure's laptop and sends them to her former colleague for decryption.
- While looking at the CCTV to find any suspects in Adele's murder, Elin discovers that Laure has been watching her stealthily when she's in the pool. Although she feels relieved to see Laure is alive, she feels scared when through the CCTV, she sees Laure was the one that pushed her into the plunge pool.
- Some of the decrypted files proved that Laure was the one that had sent threatening letters to Lucas a few weeks ago. A file of a copy of an email from Claire, a journalist, with a draft article about the hotel was built on corruption.
- Laure texted Elin that she wanted to explain and suggest to meet at a penthouse. Elin arrives early, but when the time comes, the lift opens, and Laure's dead body is on the floor. Laure is wearing the same black rubber mask Adele wore. Her throat was slitted by a right-handed. At the penthouse, Elin is attacked by a masked figure but releases her when hearing Will's footsteps. When Elin examines Laure's body to find evidence, she finds a memory stick in Laure's pocket.
- The memory stick contains some files from a psychiatric clinic in Germany, dating back to the 1920s. The information is redacted. The files got deleted from the clinic when she made a call to the clinic to enquire about it.
- Then, another staff reports that Margot is missing. Elin tracks Margot's whereabouts by logging into Margot's iCloud to find her phone's location. Margot sets up a trap to lure Elin to her. When Margot tries to kill her, Will tries to stop Margot and gets himself stabbed by Margot.
- Isaac reveals to Elin the truth about Sam's death. Sam's falling caused a brain haemorrhage impacted by the hit on a rock, and he died instantly.
Isaac went to the loo and asked Elin to look after Sam. When he returned, he saw Sam in the water and pulled Sam out. Elin was in shock at that time. Isaac consoles her not to blame herself because it was an instant death, and there was nothing she could do about it. 
- Elin and Lucas find a hidden door under the matting floor in the archive room. They go down and through the tunnel. It leads them to the place where the victims were mutilated. They find Margot died brutally there. While she is examining Margot, Lucas runs back to the archive room, closes the hatch and locks her in. 
- Elin finds the rubber mask inside the cupboard in Lucas's office. Cecile tells Elin that before Daniel was missing, a caretaker found his body in a dismembered state with a mask over his face. Lucas didn't want to report to the police because it would kill the project after it had so much opposition. Lucas removed Daniel's body, and Cecile promised to keep his secret. Adele's death is similar to Daniel, but Lucas doesn't want to tell the truth to avoid criminal charges, hoping the killer can be found soon.
- Elin runs to the main pool and finds Cecile and Lucas there. She confronts Cecile and knows Cecile is the killer. Under pressure, Cecile reveals that her brother didn't do anything after he knew Daniel Lemaitre raped her when she was 16. She was pregnant but told by her parents to get an abortion. They tried to cover up as the parents were friends with Daniel's family. When she met her husband and tried to get pregnant, she found out that she was infertile due to an infection after the abortion, which led to the marriage failure.
- Before the build started, Margot contacted the Carons about her relative being transferred to the sanatorium from a clinic in Germany. The patients had no TB. They were participants in experiments for new treatments. The women patients were sent to the clinic in Germany because of their unacceptable behaviour or unusual at the time, such as having too many ideas or being too outspoken. They found many photographs and notes about it, but Lucas wanted to keep it secret to avoid negative press for the building. Lucas ignored the graves and bribed anyone from revealing anything about the truth.
- Adele was the caretaker's girlfriend, and Lucas gave her a high-salary job to bribe her. Cecile killed Daniel and expected to be caught, but everyone wanted to cover it up. She killed Adele because she asked for more money from Lucas. 
- Margot had a psychotic depression, and Cecile used her to restrain the victims. She wanted Lucas to acknowledge her great-grandmother's story to be told or memorial, but Lucas didn't do anything.
- Cecile killed Laure because Laure knew she hacked the database to retrieve the patients' records. Cecile asked Margot to give Laure the memory stick containing the sanatorium's ugly truth, so Laure would expose them. Laure hated Lucas after the breakup but didn't want to get involved after she got back with Sam. She tried to stop Cecile before she vanished, but when Cecile refused, she had a memory stick that can trace back to Cecile.
- Margot was waiting for Cecile, not Laure, before Elin came to the penthouse. Cecile killed Laure but mistakenly left the memory stick.
- After revealing the truth to Elin, Cecile tries to kill Lucas with a knife. Elin tries to save him, but Cecile is off balance and falls towards the pool. Cecile grasps Lucas with her and tries to strangle him in the water. After a series of struggles, Elin convinces Cecile to let Lucas go, and she pulls Lucas from the water.
- Five weeks later, they leave the hotel. Cecile has been arrested. Lucas is arrested for getting rid of Daniel's body, disposing of the evidence, and covering up the truth about the sanatorium's past.
- Elin moves on with her life and plans to live with Will. 
- An unknown person is watching Elin talking to her boyfriend without her knowledge. He also indicates that he was the one who pushed her into the plunge pool.
- A news article reports that the Swiss police found 32 human graves at Le Sommet, where women were physically and mentally abused in the late 1920s and 1930s. Those women were transferred to the sanatorium from a psychiatric clinic in Germany without a legitimate medical reason. There were unmarked graves in the hotel area.

# Personal Opinions
- The brother Sam Warner died at aged 8. Why Elin sounds like he died when he was an adult? The death affects her life, and hard to move on. It seems the death even affects her job. She couldn't probably be working as a detective when she was 12. The career break is caused by the Hayler case. It sounds like everything meshes together - the brother's and mother's death, Hayler case. Sometimes, the narrative indicates that Sam died a few years ago but actually died at 8.
- If Elin already knew Laure before Sam's drowning, how can Isaac not know Laure's existence when they were in childhood? Elin said they met on social media. She mentioned Laure and her mother visited the family every August, living in their house.
- I strongly dislike Will. He seems nice in the beginning. Then he's getting pushy and lack of understanding or patience with Elin. As Elin said, he comes from an ordinary family and never understands someone from a troubled family. I feel sorry for Elin for pushing herself to meet Will's expectations.
- Why does Elin keep updating Will and Isaac on any new things she found during the investigation? I don't get it. Isn't it supposed to be discreet when investigating a murder case as a police officer?
- No likeable characters in this story. All were blaming each other's fault and justifying their theories and actions. Elin is a sad character, and Will is unsupportive and feels he is a perfect partner for Elin. Isaac is an angry, unbearable character and is always about himself. Not even halfway through the story, I wish Elin would break up with Will. Elin is not perfect and probably weak due to her past. However, it doesn't mean she's not worthy of having someone better than Will. Will feels Elin always tries to be heroic, often stopping her from doing her job. Throughout the story, I never feel that Elin is attempting to be a hero. She's a police officer, and it's expected that she has higher suspicions of others. It feels like he can't accept having a police officer as a girlfriend, stopping her from doing this and that. He seems to lack confidence in her capability and wants to be protective of her, which is sometimes annoying and unnecessary.
- Too descriptive with every architectural design and ornament or decoration. Walls, chairs, lighting, furniture, paintings etc.
- Strangely, I liked the story, but I disliked and was disappointed with the inconsistencies. For example, there isn't a clarification about the blood stain on the rug in Isaac's room unless Elin makes her own assumption and what Isaac tells her is the truth. Then, what is the story behind Isaac being sacked from the university? Elin is so sure that Laure pushed her into the plunge pool. But the epilogue indicates another person, or is it an excuse to have another book in this series? Elin is also very sure that her attacker was a man due to his body figure, but most of the villains were women in the end. It's also confusing that Elin and Laure were childhood friends, and Isaac didn't know about it but later revealed that Elin didn't keep in touch with Laure. Elin tells Will that Isaac and Laure met on social media, but at the same time, Laure and her mother visited the Warners every August, living in their house. 
- In the end, after all the things that had been done to the victims, it's difficult to be convinced that the killer is capable of doing all the things alone or even with another person's help.
