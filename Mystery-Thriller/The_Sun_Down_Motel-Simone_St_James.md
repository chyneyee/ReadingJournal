# The Sun Down Motel - Simone St. James

## Summary
The story starts with Viv Delaney, a twenty-year-old girl working at the Sun Down motel in Fell, New York. She is full of fear working the night shift alone. It was November 29, 1982. By three o'clock in the morning, Viv Delaney had vanished.

Then, the story moves forward to November 2017. Carly Kirk is a twenty-year-old girl who wakes up in a hotel room at 4 in the morning after a long drive from Illinois. She left college for the trip to Fell to look for her missing aunt, Viv Delaney.

The narration kept switching between Viv in 1982 and Carly in 2017. After a brief introduction of Carly and her intention to solve the mystery of Viv's disappearance, the story returns to August 1982. Viv came to Fell by accident. With her limited cash, the owner of the Sun Down motel offered her a night shift job to cover her expenses for the room. 

Viv continues working at the motel despite her unpleasant night shift experience. She frequently smelled smoke but couldn't find the source. She heard a lot of other noises and saw many other strange things that happened at night in the motel. One night, she had to call the police when two truckers were fighting in the parking lot. During the conversation with the policewoman Alma, Viv revealed that a boy died in the pool two years ago. A man named Henry used to work in the motel and had a heart attack when he was sitting in the same chair that Viv was in.

Back in 2017, Carly meets a local girl named Heather when Carly goes to the apartment where she believes Viv used to live. Heather assumes Carly is looking for a room after seeing the ad. After Carly explains about her aunt's disappearance, Heather offers to help Carly look for her aunt and happily asks Carly to be her new roommate.

Carly and Heather drive to the Sun Down motel and look around the place. Heather suggests that Carly apply for the motel job, which is the same night shift position that Viv worked in 1982. She is experiencing the same strange events as Viv did in 1982.

## Personal Thoughts
- The story is told by switching the accounts between Viv in 1982 and her niece Carly in 2017. Their journey is parallel from working in the motel, the apparition experience, findings about the past murders and investigating the suspected killer. When Carly meets a local man who can help with her findings, the next chapter reveals that Viv also meets a local who can help her investigate past crimes in the town.
- A lot of photo readings. Every time someone sees a photo of a person, besides the person is always beautiful, there are a lot of assumptions about how the person is (purely based on the photo).
- Slow pace. The author is trying to create more mysteries to bait the readers' interest, but it doesn't work well. It's monotonous and keeps repeating the story of the past victims and the apparition scenes in the motel. The entire story made me feel like going in circles with those and not moving forward that much.
- The elements of women empowerment or feminism in this book are too strong for me. I liked the safety awareness, but I feel annoyed with the continuous repeat of how poorly women are being treated and how strong women can be.
