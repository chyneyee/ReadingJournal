# An Anonymous Girl - Greer Hendricks & Sarah Pekkanen

## Storyline
A psychology study invites women aged 18 to 32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality conducted by a preeminent NYC psychiatrist. It was guaranteed with generous compensation and anonymity.

Jessica Farris is a makeup artist. She overheard her client's voice message regarding a psychology questionnaire that would pay $500 to the participants. Jessica is interested as the money will help to pay off her rent that month.

The questionnaire session takes two hours. It requires the participant to be honest with the first instinctive response. Jessica is rattled by the first question when it appears on the laptop screen. She never anticipates she will be confronted with such a personal question. Still, it doesn't stop her from answering the following question despite it getting more intense and invasive.

Since Jessica participates in the survey, she faces various morality questions in her daily life. After two sessions have ended, she is prompted with a question about whether she wants to expand her participation with more questions and higher rewards. The project will be switched from an academic study to a real-life discovery on morality and ethics.

The narration involves Jessica and Dr Shields or Lydia having their accounts of their perspectives about each other. Throughout the psychology study, both seem observant and intrigued with each other's personality. Dr Shields is studying Jessica thoroughly as she keeps prying for more personal information from Jessica. Meanwhile, Jessica keeps offering Dr Shields the details of her personal life with the thought of the rewarding money. Without Jessica's knowledge, she idolises Dr Shields and gets more comfortable exposing her true self, while Dr Shields enjoys listening to her secrets. What will Dr Shields go to do with the information given by Jessica, which she has hidden from her family for fifteen years?

  <summary>The Ending</summary>
Dr Shields finds out that her husband has an affair and feels that her husband is still unrepentant. Dr Shields captured a screenshot of a list of calls made by her husband's phone. With the excuse of another psychology study, she asks Jessica to give free makeup session to the list of unknown callers to find out which woman is Thomas's lover.

Then, Dr Shields set up Jessica to meet Thomas at a specific venue and time, asking her to flirt with him and get his number. Coincidentally, Jessica met Thomas before Dr Shields's arrangement when they witnessed a car accident before she went to the museum. They slept together before she knew he was Dr Shields's husband. Thomas knew that Jessica was arranged by Dr Shields to meet him. He warns Jess to be careful and tells her she is not the first woman manipulated by Dr Shields. Thomas reveals to Jessica that another young girl was taken by Dr Shields, and she showered the girl with gifts. The young girl was Subject 5, who later killed herself after meeting Dr Shields at her townhouse.

Jessica wants to leave the study after knowing the truth. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as she thinks. Dr Shields plans a vacation to Florida for Jessica's family without her. She is required to stay in New York to continue her study for Dr Shields.

Jessica and Thomas exchanged information and rehearsed the dialogues before the meeting. Jessica tells Dr Shields that Thomas rejects her because he married a wonderful woman. 

Thomas lies about his affair with a boutique owner Lauren because he thinks that is the best way to make Dr Shields leave him. Unfortunately, his plan doesn't work, and she is determined to repair the marriage.

Later in the story, Dr Shields reveals how April died and how she knew April slept with Thomas even though April never mentioned his name. April was Thomas's client for one session, but she has been obsessed with him since then. She told her story to Dr Shields on the same day before she died. Dr Shields burned the details of the last meeting with her about the revelation to protect Thomas.

When the confrontation between the three of them at the townhouse, Dr Shields reveals that she gave the Vicodin pills to April. The demeaning words she told April had pushed April to commit suicide. Dr Shields accuses Jessica of stealing her necklace during the break-in and decide to report it to the police the next day. She defends her act against April, claiming it is to protect Thomas from losing his licence.

Thomas is shocked that his wife killed April. He leaves the house with Jessica to ensure she is safe, leaving Dr Shields alone. Dr Shields is devastated by losing Thomas and prescribes herself thirty Vicodin pills and commit suicide.

At the end of the story, Jessica blackmails Thomas in exchange for keeping the information about his relationship with April.

## Personal Thoughts
- Boring. A lot of descriptions about appearances and wine drinking.
- Tried to be mysterious for Dr Shields, but the writing seems challenging to portray it.
- The thing that annoys me is the over usage of "you are told", "you are instructed", and "he is told". I think they tried to portray Dr Shields as a confident and authoritative woman, but it sounds weird and too repetitive, and sometimes, it's complicated to read because of overdoing it.
- Chapter 35 (from 69 chapters) is the peak after the first part of directionless and beating around the bush.
- More than half of the book is slow and dull, leading readers nowhere. It keeps giving Jessica experiments, which she works on like a headless chicken for the money. The peak only arrives when the husband, Thomas, knows his wife's plot. Jessica is like a pawn in this relationship between two psychologists, probably challenging each other's deceit or manipulation abilities.
- Dr Shields is manipulating Jessica's naivety and financial shortage, but Jessica is a greedy woman, which allows such disaster falls upon her.
