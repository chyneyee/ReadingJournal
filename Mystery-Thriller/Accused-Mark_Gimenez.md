  <summary>The Ending</summary>
  
Pete Puckett went to Trey's house and wanted to kill Trey. He confessed it in the courtroom when Scott questioned him. Pete went to Trey's place the morning of Trey's death. He wanted to kill Trey because he gave cocaine to his daughter. Pete returned to Trey's house at midnight and tried to kill Trey. He didn't have the courage and sat outside in the car. He didn't want to go to prison and leave Billie Jean alone.

Scott finds a seller from a produce stall and demonstrates how he cut a watermelon in the court. This also proves that Rebecca's fingerprint is on the knife because she used the knife to stab, slice and cut the watermelon found in her refrigerator at the crime scene. 

Rebecca's testimony damaged her case when she admitted that she traded sex for cocaine. The assistant D.A. found a Facebook message from Trey to Billie Jean. He said he would tell Rebecca that their relationship would be over and he would leave her for Billie Jean.

When the time for the jury's voting, Mevelyn Burke stood up and handed the judge the "Last Will and Testament of Trey Rawlins". One month before Trey died, he instructed Mevelyn to draft a will which he was supposed to sign on Monday after he was killed. The will stated that the entire estate would go to his wife, Rebecca Rawlins. He told Mevelyn about his drug and gambling debts, afraid that bad people would come after him. Twelve jurors voted unanimously to acquit Rebecca Fenney of the murder of Trey Rawlins.

Rex believed that Trey was killed by the cartel because Benito Estrada was found dead in the morning in his bed with a knife in his chest. Meanwhile, Shelby withdrew her name for the federal judgeship, and the position goes to Scott.

Rebecca didn't return home with the Fenneys. She secretly kept the mob's money without anyone's knowledge. She withdrew the three million dollars and started her new life somewhere else. It also indicates she knew Trey's affair with Billie Jean, but she took the matter into her own hands.

# Personal Opinions
- Overly detailed description of every character with specific age and other attributes.
- A long introduction with a brief summary of what happened in the previous book before it begins the story between Rebecca and Scott.
- Repetitive details, especially his heroic act from the previous book. Scott keeps correcting people about defending his "ex-wife" and not "wife", praising how beautiful his "ex-wife" was, and repetitively mentioned that she was innocent.
- There is something very wrong about Rebecca's mindset about women. Some of the views written by the author are very stereotypical and generalising women who are mostly materialistic and lying all the time, depending on the men's wealth to survive in the world. It didn't sound right when Rebecca asked Scott to return to a prestigious law firm to earn big money so their daughters won't lie to men and become independent women. I know it's a fictional character, but the views were hard to accept and disturbing even though the dialogues were tailored-made for Rebecca.
- A lot of Q&A sessions that are not related to the case. It seems there are a lot of explanations and justifications in the book.
- Overwhelmed with golf terminology. I understand it was related to a golf pro, but it can be reduced. A reader like me who had no idea about golf found the story dull. The golf was too much for me, making the story less enjoyable. It feels like if you don't know anything about golf, you won't know how to appreciate this story. It also has too much geographical history. This book seems specifically for Texans that love golf.
- Everything is too convenient for Scott. The prosecutor and thugs were willing to cooperate and tell him everything. Renee let go of her seduction and talks to him like a friend. All beautiful women wanted Scott; bad people would tell him whatever he wanted. 
- What's wrong with the women in this book? Most were ambitious and motive-driven and tended to achieve their goals with seduction.
