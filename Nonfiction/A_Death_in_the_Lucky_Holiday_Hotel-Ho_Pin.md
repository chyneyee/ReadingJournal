# A Death in the Lucky Holiday Hotel: Murder, Money, and an Epic Power Struggle in China - Pin Ho

## Summary
For the sake of clear and compelling storytelling, the narration of this story uses the voice of Ho Pin, a commentator on Chinese politics who had revealed several critical events in the Bo Xilai scandal. This book intends to offer the insight of a political murder that set the cornerstone for the power fight at the highest echelons.

The authors interviewed more than fifty current and former government officials, well-connected businesspeople, veteran political analysts and independent journalists for their knowledge about the Bo Xilai case and the internal structure of the Communist Party. Besides following the daily postings on Weibo, Wenguang Huang posing as a tourist in Chongqing and visited and photographed the hotel where British businessman Neil Heywood was killed. 

Neil Heywood's body was found in Room 1605 of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel, or Lucky Holiday Hotel, a three-star resort about eight kilometres from downtown Chongqing. He checked into a private villa suite on November 13, 2011, during the off-season month. He was forty-one with a British passport and a Beijing address. He was last seen with a middle-aged Chinese woman who flipped on the door's "Do Not Disturb" sign before she left. Two days later, he was found dead on his bed. Three days after the body was found, the case was closed with the conclusion "sudden death after drinking alcohol".

At the beginning of the year 2022, the author received a call about Wang Lijun, the Chongqing city's police chief, who had just been sacked and was under internal investigation and charged with corruption. He was the right-hand man of Bo Xilai, the party chief of Chongqing and a rising political star. The news soon went viral across the Internet.
The anonymous caller kept feeding the author with more shocking revelations about Wang's corruption allegations which led Bo Xilai to distance himself from Wang by sacking him from the police chief's position. In retaliation, Wang sent a letter to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, accusing Bo and his wife of taking bribes and transferring a massive sum of assets abroad. The pair looked united in front of the cameras a few days later, but Wang chose to seek asylum at the US Consulate less than two days after. However, his asylum plea failed, and he was detained in Beijing for interrogation.

The tension continues to build up, and the focus switches to Bo Xilai's political career. With the help of his friends and supporters, Bo thought he would survive the political turmoil and remain the key challenger for the Party's successor. Unfortunately, his unscripted speech at the National People's Congress (NPC) was the first nail in the coffin of his political career.

## Personal Thoughts
Wow. The beginning of the book was already mind-blowing. It was so scandalous and intriguing to read. The journalistic writing style might not be everyone's cup of tea; some readers probably feel that it's slightly dull for reading. However, I really enjoyed reading the book because it offers very insightful content, although sometimes it can be complicated to follow the timeline.

When reading the part of Bo Xilai's digressions at the NPC press conference, I'm slightly surprised that he would follow his wife's instructions without weighing the consequences of his actions. Besides his wife as the chief contributor to his fall, I think another factor was his overconfidence and heedlessness towards the situation. I wonder if things would be slightly different if he stayed low and more cautious until the coast was clear.

I thought Gu was the killer and never expected the case to have many inconsistencies and loopholes. I'm not surprised if it was a political conspiracy, but I never thought what a mess from the beginning. It involved many people and sacrifices to stop a politician from rising to power. If the conspiracy is true, I wonder what would be the Party's tactics if Gu is a good citizen who obeys the law? Somehow, I feel Bo's family can only blame themselves for their downfall. There's a saying, "If you are a righteous person, no one can plot anything against you". However, at the same time, politics can be a dark place. We don't know for sure what is the truth for most of the widespread speculations.

In summary, most Chinese politicians' success comes from thirty per cent of their personal effort or capability, and seventy per cent is from working for connections and lobbying allies. Then, regardless of the hard work, their future is in the hands of their family members. Most of their downfall was caused by their spouse or children. Some seemed to have a promising future at the beginning of their career. Unfortunately, they were blinded by money and power and "died" horribly in the end, which was caused by their own act or family. 

Reading the entire political turmoil and how politicians try to grasp power to climb to higher-ranking positions in China, one can conclude that whoever becomes the President of China is not a simple person. In Chinese terms, not a simple person refers to someone who shouldn't be undermined because he probably has a solid background of support and unknown tactics that allow him to survive in such a challenging environment.
