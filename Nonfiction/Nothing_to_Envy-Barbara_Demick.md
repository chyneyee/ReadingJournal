# Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea - Barbara Demick

## Storyline
Barbara Demick moved to Seoul as a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times back in 2001. This book is based on seven years of conversations with North Koreans. The content primarily focuses on the lives of several North Korean defectors, mainly in Chongjin, with different backgrounds and the reasons that pushed them to risk their lives to defect to South Korea.

## Notes
- North Korea faded to black in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
- Mi-ran is a defector from North Korea.
- A history of Mi-ran's father, born in South Korea, was a former soldier and had been through Japanese occupation. His life in South Korea was over when he was taken as a prisoner of war during the Korean War. His background being ranked as one of the lowest categories later affects the lives of her children's future.
- Mi-ran's former boyfriend, Jun-sang, must be cautious with his move as he's the only hope to change his family's social level. His parents are Koreans born in Japan. Although the father is an engineer and the family is more prosperous than most North Koreans, they possess a low position due to the family background related to Japan.
- Mrs Song is a true believer in the Kim dynasty. Her husband, a journalist with access to more information from the outside world, knows their leader's lies. He and his close friend discreetly share their criticism and even reveals the dynasty's failure and the success of South Korea's capitalism to his eldest daughter whenever the wife is not around.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union deprived North Korea of its primary source of economic aid, causing a devastating impact on the entire nation. The shortage of raw materials affected factory production, and the reduction of electricity also affected the factories and agriculture; lacking jobs, income and food caused hunger among the people. The city people were taking trips to the countryside to scavenge for food and pick up firewood in the mountains.
- Doctors still need to travel to hike far into the mountains to gather herbs. It reminds me of ancient China when physicians still need to gather medicinal herbs as medicines for their patients.
- It also touches on the issues of struggling hospitals with patients filled with various diseases and illnesses. Eventually, the hospital was emptied because people stopped bringing their sick loved ones.
- During the famine in the 90s, people are trying various creative methods to gain food to prevent death by starvation. Some people who used to obey the stringent rules had to ignore their principles for survival. Good people died young because they followed the rules and didn't commit any crimes, not even lying or stealing food.

## Personal Thoughts
No matter how many books I've read or how many stories of someone trying to escape from North Korea, I always hope they make it in the end. Even when I'm reading an account of a defector who I knew had successfully escaped the country in the end, I still hope or pray that at that stage, when they are running away, they can make it in the end. It's always in my mind like, "Run! Run! Run far far away!". I'm so glad Mrs Song finally woke up and decided to leave for South Korea.
